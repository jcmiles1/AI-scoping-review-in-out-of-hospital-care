OBJECTIVE: We conducted a cluster analysis for a cohort of OHCA survivors to examine the association of clinical and social factors for mortality at 1 year. METHODS: We used a retrospective observational OHCA cohort identified from Medicare claims data, including area-level social determinants of health (SDOH) features and hospital-level data sets. We applied k-means clustering algorithms to identify subphenotypes of beneficiaries who had survived an OHCA and examined associations of outcomes by subphenotype. RESULTS: We identified 27,028 unique beneficiaries who survived to discharge after OHCA. We derived 4 distinct subphenotypes. Subphenotype 1 included a distribution of more urban, female, and Black beneficiaries with the least robust area-level SDOH measures and the highest 1-year mortality (2375/4417, 53.8%). Subphenotype 2 was characterized by a greater distribution of male, White beneficiaries and had the strongest zip code-level SDOH measures, with 1-year mortality at 49.9% (4577/9165). Subphenotype 3 had the highest rates of cardiac catheterization at 34.7% (1342/3866) and the greatest distribution with a driving distance to the index OHCA hospital from their primary residence >16.1 km at 85.4% (8179/9580); more were also discharged to a skilled nursing facility after index hospitalization. Subphenotype 4 had moderate median household income at US $51,659.50 (IQR US $41,295 to $67,081) and moderate to high median unemployment at 5.5% (IQR 4.2%-7.1%), with the lowest 1-year mortality (1207/3866, 31.2%). Joint modeling of these features demonstrated an increased hazard of death for subphenotypes 1 to 3 but not for subphenotype 4 when compared to reference. CONCLUSIONS: We identified 4 distinct subphenotypes with differences in outcomes by clinical and area-level SDOH features for OHCA. Further work is needed to determine if individual or other SDOH domains are specifically tied to long-term survival after OHCA.",10.2196/51844,Sdoh;algorithm;algorithms;association;associations;cardiac;cardiology;cluster;clustering;cohort;death;heart;k-means;machine learning;mortality;myocardial;observational;out-of-hospital-cardiac arrest;phenotype;phenotypes;retrospective;social determinants of health;subphenotype;subphenotypes;survival;survive;survivor;survivors

The operational efficiency of such services is critical and adequate demand forecasts can contribute to such a goal. But for that, the available data need to be well characterized before being used. Previous studies have failed to address some important aspects of this need, such as exploring a comprehensive list of contextual data to decide which are relevant to explain the EMS demand behavior. Moreover, modern forecasting techniques have been explored in the EMS context, including neural networks, but the computational complexity inherent to the methods and their use was not discussed. Finally, it is also unclear how different demand patterns can be when predicting the volume of emergency calls considering the priority level and the number of dispatches according to vehicle type. This study proposes a generic data-driven forecasting method to address these shortcomings and to support operational decisions. The results obtained with the proposed method indicate that each priority call and vehicle type shows different patterns, which suggests that such differentiation should contribute to better resource allocation. At the same time, the operational impact of the demand shared by neighboring zones proved to be significant at bases near the border. The models developed resulted in important decision tools that can be used to predict the dynamic demand of EMS on an hourly or shift basis. Additionally, the method adds value for decision-makers that want to plan not only when and how many but also where resources are demanded, avoiding assumptions that impact the operational performance.",ARTN 101492     10.1016/j.seps.2022.101492,emergency medical services;forecasting;data-driven;neural networks;ems calls;ambulance service demand;ambulance location;neural-networks;demand;optimization;challenges;prediction;management;model

OBJECTIVE: Based on the data from the Medical Emergency System of Bogota, Colombia, we first sought to characterize the prehospital re- sponse in cardiac arrest and determine with the model which is the least number of resources necessary to respond within eight minutes, taking into account their location, number, and type. METHODS: A database of incidents reported in administrative records of the district health authority of Bogota (2014 to 2017) was obtained. Based on this information, a hybrid model based on discrete event simulation and genetic algorithms was designed to establish the amount, type and geographic location of resources according to the frequencies and typology of the events. RESULTS: From the database, Bogota presented 938 671 ambulances dispatches in the period. 47.4% high priority, 18.9% medium and 33.74% low. 92% of these corresponded to 15 of 43 medical emergency codes. The response times recorded were longer than expected, especially in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (median 19 minutes). In the proposed model, the best scenario required at least 281 ambulances, medicalized and basic in a 3:1 ratio, respectively, to respond in adequate time. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest the need for an increase in the resources that respond to these incidents to bring these response times to the needs of our population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included"", ""Charlotte""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: 3.

However, the traditional prototypes designed for such an unmanned vehicle do not match the demands of the advanced communication technologies incorporated in today's sophisticated distributed networks. As a result, in the current era of edge computing strengthened by many AI-enabled algorithms, there is an urgent need to design a route resource recommendation (R3) protocol for ACA under Edge-AI. Designing such a protocol requires addressing the major challenges to optimize the routes for ACA and, thereby, enhance the services of emergency eHealth centers through a governing telehealth monitoring administrator. Therefore, in this article, a dedicated and novel ACA-R3 protocol is proposed to address the issues of connectivity and resource management in ACA to optimize the routes for ACA. The ACA-R3 protocol abides by the operational standards of both the eHealth protocol and governing protocol. The primary objective of the current research work was to reduce the handover time and simplify the patient-information exchange during the time of demanded emergencies. The proposed ACA-R3 protocol can enhance the collaborative distributive resource management for reliable decision making from the data generated by the GPS tracking unit in ACA and Edge-AI.

We described patterns of non-fatal opioid overdoses (NFOODs) in a small western region using data from the 9-1-1 Computer Assisted Dispatch (CAD) record and electronic Patient Clinical Records (ePCR) completed by EMS responders. We determined whether CAD and ePCR variables could identify NFOOD cases in 9-1-1 data for intervention and surveillance efforts. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1 year of 9-1-1 emergency medical CAD and ePCR (including naloxone administration) data from the sole EMS provider in the response area. Cases were identified based on clinician review of the ePCR, and categorized as definitive NFOOD, probable NFOOD, or non-OOD. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) of the most prevalent CAD and ePCR variables were calculated. We used a machine learning technique-Random-Forests (RF) modeling-to optimize our ability to accurately predict NFOOD cases within census blocks. Results: Of 37,960 9-1-1 calls, clinical review identified 158 NFOOD cases (0.4%), of which 123 (77.8%) were definitive and 35 (22.2%) were probable cases. Overall, 106 (67.1%) received naloxone from the EMS responder at the scene. As a predictor of NFOOD, naloxone administration by paramedics had 67.1% sensitivity, 99.6% specificity, 44% PPV, and 99.9% NPV. Using CAD variables alone achieved a sensitivity of 36.7% and specificity of 99.7%. Combining ePCR variables with CAD variables increased the diagnostic accuracy with the best RF model yielding 75.9% sensitivity, 99.9% specificity, 71.4% PPV, and 99.9% NPV. Conclusion: CAD problem type variables and naloxone administration, used alone or in combination, had sub-optimal predictive accuracy. However, a Random Forests modeling approach improved accuracy of identification, which could foster improved surveillance and intervention efforts.

An automated stroke screening tool could improve stroke outcomes by facilitating more accurate prehospital diagnosis and delivery. We hypothesize that a machine learning algorithm using video analysis can detect common signs of stroke. As a proof-of-concept study, we trained a computer algorithm to detect presence and laterality of facial weakness in publically available videos with comparable accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity to paramedics. METHODS AND RESULTS: We curated videos of people with unilateral facial weakness (n = 93) and with a normal smile (n = 96) from publicly available web-based sources. Three board certified vascular neurologists categorized the videos according to the presence or absence of weakness and laterality. Three paramedics independently analyzed each video with a mean accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 92.6% [95% CI 90.1-94.7%], 87.8% [95% CI 83.9-91.7%] and 99.3% [95% CI 98.2-100%].

CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest that a machine learning algorithm using computer vision analysis can detect unilateral facial weakness in pre-recorded videos with an accuracy and sensitivity comparable to trained paramedics.

Unfortunately, this approach does not measure how strong each factor is in predicting survival after OHCA. AIM: To investigate the relative importance of 16 well-recognized factors in OHCA at the time point of ambulance arrival, and before any interventions or medications were given, by using a machine learning approach that implies building models directly from the data, and arranging those factors in order of importance in predicting survival. METHODS: Using a data-driven approach with a machine learning algorithm, we studied the relative importance of 16 factors assessed during the pre-hospital phase of OHCA. We examined 45,000 cases of OHCA between 2008 and 2016. RESULTS: Overall, the top five factors to predict survival in order of importance were: initial rhythm, age, early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR, time to CPR and CPR before arrival of EMS), time from EMS dispatch until EMS arrival, and place of cardiac arrest. The largest difference in importance was noted between initial rhythm and the remaining predictors. A number of factors, including time of arrest and sex were of little importance. CONCLUSION: Using machine learning, we confirm that the most important predictor of survival in OHCA is initial rhythm, followed by age, time to start of CPR, EMS response time and place of OHCA.

The result of this has been a proliferation of challenges for authorities with regard to road traffic management. A consequence of this has been congestion of traffic, more accidents, and pollution. Accidents are a still major cause of death, despite the development of sophisticated systems for traffic management and other technologies linked with vehicles. Hence, it is necessary that a common system for accident management is developed. For instance, traffic congestion inmost urban areas can be alleviated by the real-time planning of routes. However, the designing of an efficient route planning algorithm to attain a globally optimal vehicle control is still a challenge that needs to be solved, especially when the unique preferences of drivers are considered. The aim of this paper is to establish an accident management system that makes use of vehicular ad hoc networks coupled with systems that employ cellular technology in public transport. This system ensures the possibility of real-time communication among vehicles, ambulances, hospitals, roadside units, and central servers. In addition, the accident management system is able to lessen the amount of time required to alert an ambulance that it is required at an accident scene by using a multihop optimal forwarding algorithm. Moreover, an optimal route planning algorithm (ORPA) is proposed in this system to improve the aggregate spatial use of a road network, at the same time bringing down the travel cost of operating a vehicle. This can reduce the incidence of vehicles being stuck on congested roads. Simulations are performed to evaluate ORPA, and the results are compared with existing algorithms. The evaluation results provided evidence that ORPA outperformed others in terms of average ambulance speed and travelling time. Finally, our system makes it easier for ambulance to quickly make their way through traffic congestion so that the chance of saving lives is increased.",Artn 6168981     10.1155/2018/6168981,ad hoc networks;delivery;scheme

The aim of this study was to develop a reliable pulse detection algorithm using the electrocardiogram (ECG) and thoracic impedance (TI), the signals available in most defibrilators. The dataset used in the study consisted of 1140 ECG and TI segments from 187 OHCA patients, whereof 792 were labelled as pulse-generating rhythm (PR) and 348 as pulseless electrical activity (PEA) by a pool of experts in OHCA. First, an adaptive filtering scheme was used to extract the impedance circulation component and its first derivative from the TI. Then, the wavelet decomposition of the ECG was carried out to obtain the different subband components and the denoised ECG. Pulse/no-pulse (PR/PEA) discrimination features were extracted from those signals and fed into a support vector machine (SVM) classifier that made the pulse/no-pulse decision. A quasi-stratified and patient wise nested cross validation procedure was used to select the best feature subset and to tune the SVM hyperparameters. This procedure was repeated 50 times to estimate the statistical distributions of the performance metrics of the method.

This problem arises in the context of seeking to reduce expected ambulance response times, which was within 27 minutes in SAo Paulo for 98% of the requests. In order to bring down total response times closer to internationally acceptable standards, SAMU-SP devised the concept of moveable ambulance stations that can be installed in available public spaces, such as squares and parks, and can be periodically relocated to ensure a good coverage at all times. This new concept, however, was not an easy sell. It was necessary to demonstrate clearly the benefits that such stations, if properly located, could provide in the context of limited budgetary resources when compared to the traditional facilities in regular buildings. In this context, we propose a novel artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to guide SAMU-SP in its strategic decisions involving their service network, as well as in the allocation and repositioning of ambulances to each stand-by point in order to cope with varying demand at different time periods. This model was applied to analyze different scenarios, including one that was implemented in the short term and yielded an improvement of over 40% in the expected coverage.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included"", ""Leanne""=>""Excluded"", ""Charlotte""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: mop,A.

This type of transportation faces several issues, such as road safety, navigation and communication, time-critical operations, resource utilisation, traffic congestion, data processing and analysis, and individual safety. Vehicle navigation and coordination is a critical aspect of emergency response that involves guiding emergency vehicles, such as ambulances, to the location of an emergency or medical centre as quickly and safely as possible. Therefore, it requires additional effort to reduce driving risks. The roadside units support emergency vehicles and infrastructure to decrease collisions and enhance optimal navigation routes. However, during the emergency vehicle's data communication and navigation process, communication is interrupted due to vehicle outages. Therefore, this study proposes the Navigation Data Processing for Assisted Driving (NDP-AD) method to address the problem. The proposed approach assimilates infrastructure and neighbouring location information during driving. The integrated information is processed for distance and traffic during the previous displacement interval. The NDP-AD method employs a recurrent neural network learning approach to analyse opposing vehicle distance and traffic to provide accurate, independent guidance. This effective learning-based guidance process minimises false navigations and deviation in displacement. System efficiency is evaluated based on processing latency, displacement error, data utilisation, false rate, and accuracy metrics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included"", ""Charlotte""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: 2.

These actions include the employment of emergency plans and assigned resources to (i) rescue affected people immediately, (ii) deliver personnel, medical care and equipment to the disaster area, and (iii) aid to prevent the infrastructural and environmental losses. In the response phase, humanitarian logistics directly influence the efficiency of the relief operation. Ambulances routing problem is defined as employing the optimisation tools to manage the flow of ambulances for finding the best ambulance tours to transport the injured to hospitals. Researchers pointed out the importance of equity and fairness in humanitarian relief services: managing the operations of ambulances in the immediate aftermath of a disaster must be done impartially and efficiently to rescue affected people with different priority in accordance with the restrictions. Our research aim is to find the best ambulance tours to transport the patients during a disaster in relief operations while considering fairness and equity to deliver services to patients in balance. The problem is formulated as a new variant of the team orienteering problem with hierarchical objectives to address also the efficiency issue. Due to the limitation of solving the proposed model using a general-purpose solver, we propose a new hybrid algorithm based on a machine learning and neighbourhood search. Based on a new set of realistic benchmark instances, our quantitative analysis proves that our algorithm is capable to largely reduce the solution running time especially when the complexity of the problem increases. Further, a comparison between the fair solution and the system optimum solution is also provided.",10.1007/s10100-021-00785-y,Ambulance routing;Fairness;Post disaster management;Team orienteering problem

This study analysed the spatio-temporal distribution of OHCAs, STEMIs, and strokes, their spatio-temporal correlation, and the performance of different prediction algorithms. METHODS: Adults who experienced an OHCA, STEMI, or stroke in Canton Ticino, Switzerland from 2005 to 2022 were included. Datasets were divided into training and validation samples. To estimate and predict the yearly per-capita population incidences of OHCA, STEMI, and stroke, the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA), machine learning meta model (MLMM), the Naive prediction method, and the exponential moving average were employed and compared. The relationship between OHCA, STEMI, and stroke was assessed by predicting the incidence of one condition, considering the lagged incidence of the other two as explanatory variables. RESULTS: We included 3,906 OHCAs, 2,162 STEMIs, and 2,536 stroke patients. INLA and MLMM yearly predicted incidence OHCA, STEMI, and stroke at municipality level with very high accuracy, outperforming the Naive forecasting and the exponential moving average. INLA exhibited errors of zero or one event in 82%, 87%, and 72% of municipalities for OHCA, STEMI, and stroke, respectively, whereas ML had errors in 81%, 89%, and 71% of municipalities for the same conditions. INLA had a prediction error of 0.87, 0.77, and 1.50 events per year per municipality for OHCA, STEMI and stroke, whereas MLMM of 0.70, 0.74, and 1.09 events, respectively. Including in the INLA model the lagged absolute values of the other conditions as covariates improved the prediction of OHCA and stroke but not STEMI. MLMM predictions were consistently the most accurate and did not benefit from the inclusion of the other conditions as covariates. All the three diseases showed a similar spatial pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Prediction of incidence of OHCA, STEMI, and stroke is possible with very high accuracy using INLA and MLMM models. A robust spatio-temporal correlation between the 3 pathologies exists. Widespread implementation in clinical practice of prediction algorithms may allow to improve resource allocation, reduce treatment delays, and improve outcomes.",10.1016/j.resplu.2024.100810,Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest;ST-elevation myocardial infarction;Spatio-temporal prediction;Stroke

Most of the accidents and/or sudden diseases require quick aid due to its relation to people‚Äôs life, and the least time might affect the result of the aid significantly. It is noteworthy that finding the appropriate solution is under influence of considering the financial and treatment limitations. Integration of decision making in relief logistics leads to establish a better condition. Also, with regards to the unpredictability of relief demand, uncertain conditions should be investigated in a more appropriate way of planning process. This paper investigates a comprehensive and multi-level emergency Location allocation routing emergency problem under uncertain conditions with stable response to the different situations. In the presented model, the demand is defined by the emergency stations in order to represent the actual situations in real world. On the other hand, by the increase in the rate of providing services by the ambulances, the length of the queue will decrease and the costs will reduce due to the increase in the efficiency of the ambulances. A simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is developed to solve the problem. The obtained results show that the proposed algorithm has good performance.

How to provide timely and effective treatment to the injured under the condition of rudimentary out-of-hospital environment and limited medical resource is a crucial aspect of emergency medical rescue. Triage can make full use of the prime time of critical care to carry out timely and correct assessment to patients, which not only improves the utilization of emergency materials, but also effectively reduces disabling rate and mortality rate of the injured patients. The traditional triage methods based on scale scores is highly subjective and biased, leading to inaccurate assessment results. In this study, a deep ensemble learning approach is proposed for triage. First of all, due to the scarcity of physiological data record in disasters and battlefields, we combined the physiological data in the eICU database, and established irregular physiological temporal series as input after significant data cleaning. Then, several single deep learning models mainly for time series analysis were constructed for training, and two base classifiers, GRU (Embedding) and Informer, were selected by combining three evaluation metrics, namely precision, recall and F1 score. Finally, soft voting was taken to integrate the results of the three base classifiers. The experimental results showed that the proposed method improved the precision, recall, and F1 score to 0.912, 0.911 and 0.911, respectively. Our deep ensemble model improves the accuracy of triage successfully.

Many emergency medical services (EMS) activate catheterization labs to reduce time to PPCI, but suffer a high burden of inappropriate activations. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms show promise to improve electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation. The primary objective was to evaluate the potential of AI to reduce false positive activations without missing OMI. METHODS: Electrocardiograms were categorized by (1) STEMI criteria, (2) ECG integrated device software and (3) a proprietary AI algorithm (Queen of Hearts (QOH), Powerful Medical). If multiple ECGs were obtained and any one tracing was positive for a given method, that diagnostic method was considered positive. The primary outcome was OMI defined as an angiographic culprit lesion with either TIMI 0-2 flow; or TIMI 3 flow with either peak high sensitivity troponin-I > 5000 ng/L or new wall motion abnormality. The primary analysis was per-patient proportion of false positives. RESULTS: A total of 140 patients were screened and 117 met criteria. Of these, 48 met the primary outcome criteria of OMI. There were 80 positives by STEMI criteria, 88 by device algorithm, and 77 by AI software. All approaches reduced false positives, 27% for STEMI, 22% for device software, and 34% for AI (p < 0.01 for all). The reduction in false positives did not significantly differ between STEMI criteria and AI software (p = 0.19) but STEMI criteria missed 6 (5%) OMIs, while AI missed none (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center retrospective study, an AI-driven algorithm reduced false positive diagnoses of OMI compared to EMS clinician gestalt. Compared to AI (which missed no OMI), STEMI criteria also reduced false positives but missed 6 true OMI.

Proper maintenance of a patient's medical record has been a hindrance toward the growth of Telehealth services. The patient's data, particularly emergency data, must be available to medical personnel within a short time frame and independent of potential interruption of network connections. In this paper, we propose a Near Field Communication (NFC) wristband that provides access to the medical details, history and contact details of a patient. By this, the doctor or the paramedical officer can provide the patient with the best treatment within a short period of time. This system comes in handy even if the patient is unconscious/unable to answer. The doctor or the paramedical officer can quickly draft a patient's report and send it to the hospital. The proposed framework consists of the following four stages: (i) obtaining emergency medical data with the help of NFC chips, (ii) converting medical report into digital text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), (iii) structuring the narrative medical text into organized data using NLP and (iv) comparative analysis of the selected content. An image database with 1200 medical case histories has been utilized for the algorithm development and validation. The OCR algorithms for converting images to text produced more than 98% on average and NLP algorithm produced around 94.1% accuracy. Overall, the performance of the system from NFC reader till analysis of the specific field is more than 95%.

The majority of the adaptive TLC systems are designed for homogeneous traffic of four-wheeler vehicles and are responsive to the prevailing traffic conditions at a junction. Further, they do not serve priority vehicles such as public transport (buses) or emergency vehicles (ambulance, fire trucks, etc.). The traffic dynamics considered in this work are less-lane-disciplined, heterogeneous traffic (two-three-four-wheeler vehicles), as found in the majority of developing countries. This work proposes a novel adaptive TLC system for heterogeneous traffic scenarios which is responsive to the prevailing traffic conditions at a junction, and also serves priority vehicles at a preference than the regular traffic. The proposed system supports multiple levels of priority among the priority vehicles, and efficiently schedules traffic lights at a junction to cause minimal interruption to the other regular traffic.For heterogeneous traffic monitoring, we use the Passenger Car Unit (PCU) count of the vehicles, which are computed using computer vision-based object detection models. The performance of deep learning-based object detection algorithms such as YOLO, RCNN, is analyzed experimentally for the computation requirements, and accuracy in computing PCU count. Simulations are carried out to analyze the effect of varying error rates in PCU count, and congestion level on the performance of the proposed adaptive TLC. The effect of the proposed adaptive TLC on the average travel and waiting times, of the priority vehicles and the other regular traffic is assessed. The simulation results suggest that the proposed algorithm can tolerate 20% error in the PCU count without degrading the performance. Additionally, this work demonstrates that the traffic information with the required accuracy can be processed in real-time using the available micro-controllers (e.g., Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano).",10.1016/j.cie.2022.108503,adaptive traffic light control;priority vehicles;intelligent transportation system;heterogeneous traffic;computer vision;optimization

OBJECTIVE: To examine how a machine learning model trained to identify OHCA and alert dispatchers during emergency calls affected OHCA recognition and response. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This double-masked, 2-group, randomized clinical trial analyzed all calls to emergency number 112 (equivalent to 911) in Denmark. Calls were processed by a machine learning model using speech recognition software. The machine learning model assessed ongoing calls, and calls in which the model identified OHCA were randomized. The trial was performed at Copenhagen Emergency Medical Services, Denmark, between September 1, 2018, and December 31, 2019. INTERVENTION: Dispatchers in the intervention group were alerted when the machine learning model identified out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and those in the control group followed normal protocols without alert. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was the rate of dispatcher recognition of subsequently confirmed OHCA. RESULTS: A total of 169‚ÄØ049 emergency calls were examined, of which the machine learning model identified 5242 as suspected OHCA. Calls were randomized to control (2661 [50.8%]) or intervention (2581 [49.2%]) groups. Of these, 336 (12.6%) and 318 (12.3%), respectively, had confirmed OHCA. The mean (SD) age among of these 654 patients was 70 (16.1) years, and 419 of 627 patients (67.8%) with known gender were men. Dispatchers in the intervention group recognized 296 confirmed OHCA cases (93.1%) with machine learning assistance compared with 304 confirmed OHCA cases (90.5%) using standard protocols without machine learning assistance (P = .15). Machine learning alerts alone had a significantly higher sensitivity than dispatchers without alerts for confirmed OHCA (85.0% vs 77.5%; P < .001) but lower specificity (97.4% vs 99.6%; P < .001) and positive predictive value (17.8% vs 55.8%; P < .001).

We examined whether a machine learning framework could recognize out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from audio files of calls to the emergency medical dispatch center. METHODS: For all incidents responded to by Emergency Medical Dispatch Center Copenhagen in 2014, the associated call was retrieved. A machine learning framework was trained to recognize cardiac arrest from the recorded calls. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for recognizing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were calculated. The performance of the machine learning framework was compared to the actual recognition and time-to-recognition of cardiac arrest by medical dispatchers. RESULTS: We examined 108,607 emergency calls, of which 918 (0.8%) were out-of-hospital cardiac arrest calls eligible for analysis. Compared with medical dispatchers, the machine learning framework had a significantly higher sensitivity (72.5% vs. 84.1%, p < 0.001) with lower specificity (98.8% vs. 97.3%, p < 0.001). The machine learning framework had a lower positive predictive value than dispatchers (20.9% vs. 33.0%, p < 0.001).

Academic/practical relevance: OHCA claims more than 400,000 lives each year in North America and is one of the most time-sensitive medical emergencies. Drone-delivered automated external defibrillators (AEDs) have the potential to be a transformative innovation in the provision of emergency care for OHCA. Methodology: We develop an integrated location-queuing model that incorporates existing EMS response times and is based on the p-median architecture, where each base constitutes an explicit M/M/d/d queue (i.e., Erlang loss). We then develop a reformulation technique that exploits the existing EMS response times, allowing us to solve real-world instances to optimality using an off-the-shelf solver. We evaluate our solutions using a tactical simulation model that accounts for the effects of congestion and dispatching, and we use a machine-learning model to translate our response-time reductions into survival estimates. Results: Using real data from an area covering 26,000 square kilometers around Toronto, Canada, we find that a modest number of drones are required to significantly reduce response times in all regions. An objective function that minimizes average response time results in drone resources concentrated in cities, with little impact on the tail of the distribution. In contrast, optimizing for the tail of the response-time distribution produces larger and more geographically dispersed drone networks that improve response-time equity across the regions. We estimate that the response-time reductions achieved by the drone network are associated with between a 42% and 76% higher survival rate and up to 144 additional lives saved each year across the geographical region we consider. Managerial implications: Overall, this paper provides a realistic framework that can be leveraged by system designers and/or EMS personnel seeking to investigate design questions associated with a drone network. An objective function focused on improving the tail of the response-time distribution is well-suited for use in practice because the model provides equitable solutions that reduce the entire response-time distribution and corresponds to the real-world metrics, on which EMS systems are most commonly evaluated.",10.1287/msom.2022.1092,facility location;queuing;emergency medical services;drones;optimization;machine learning;public-access defibrillation;cardiopulmonary-resuscitation;ambulance location;facility location;station location;delivery network;server location;survival;optimization;allocation

Using 179 morphological ECG features, we trained, cross-validated, and tested a random forest classifier to augment non ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) diagnosis. RESULTS: Our sample included 2,122 patients (age 59 [16]; 53% women; 44% Black, 13.5% confirmed acute coronary syndrome). The rate of diagnostic ST elevation and ST depression were 5.9% and 16.2% on out-of-hospital-ECG and 6.1% and 12.4% on ED ECG, with approximately 40% of changes seen on out-of-hospital-ECG persisting and approximately 60% resolving. Using expert interpretation of out-of-hospital-ECG alone gave poor baseline performance with area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC), sensitivity, and negative predictive values of 0.69, 0.50, and 0.92. Using expert interpretation of serial ECG changes enhanced this performance (AUC 0.80, sensitivity 0.61, and specificity 0.93). Interestingly, augmenting the out-of-hospital-ECG alone with artificial intelligence algorithms boosted its performance (AUC 0.83, sensitivity 0.75, and specificity 0.95), yielding a net reclassification improvement of 29.5% against expert ECG interpretation. CONCLUSION: In this study, 60% of diagnostic ST changes resolved prior to hospital arrival, making the ED ECG suboptimal for the inhospital evaluation of NSTE-ACS. Using serial ECG changes or incorporating artificial intelligence-augmented analyses would allow correctly reclassifying one in 4 patients with suspected NSTE-ACS.",10.1016/j.annemergmed.2022.08.005,Humans;Female;Middle Aged;Male;*Acute Coronary Syndrome/diagnosis;Artificial Intelligence;Prospective Studies;Electrocardiography;Machine Learning;Hospitals

The implementation of these LLMs for EMS quality assurance has the potential to significantly reduce the workload on medical directors and quality assurance staff by automating aspects of the processing and review of patient care reports. This offers the potential for more efficient and accurate identification of areas requiring improvement, thereby potentially enhancing patient care outcomes. METHODS: Two expert human reviewers, ChatGPT GPT-4, and Gemini Ultra assessed and rated 150 consecutively sampled and anonymized prehospital records from 2 large urban EMS agencies for adherence to 2020 National Association of State EMS metrics for cardiac care. We evaluated the accuracy of scoring, inter-rater reliability, and review efficiency. The inter-rater reliability for the dichotomous outcome of each EMS metric was measured using the kappa statistic. RESULTS: Human reviewers showed high interrater reliability, with 91.2% agreement and a kappa coefficient 0.782 (0.654-0.910). ChatGPT-4 achieved substantial agreement with human reviewers in EKG documentation and aspirin administration (76.2% agreement, kappa coefficient 0.401 (0.334-0.468), but performance varied across other metrics. Gemini Ultra's evaluation was discontinued due to poor performance. No significant differences were observed in median review times: 01:28 min (IQR 1:12 - 1:51 min) per human chart review, 01:24 min (IQR 01:09 - 01:53 min) per ChatGPT-4 chart review (p = 0.46), and 01:50 min (IQR 01:10-03:34 min) per Gemini Ultra review (p = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Large language models demonstrate potential in supporting quality assurance by effectively and objectively extracting data elements. However, their accuracy in interpreting non-standardized and time-sensitive details remains inferior to human evaluators. Our findings suggest that current LLMs may best offer supplemental support to the human review processes, but their current value remains limited. Enhancements in LLM training and integration are recommended for improved and more reliable performance in the quality assurance processes.",10.1080/10903127.2024.2376757,

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to develop machine learning models to classify self-harm related behaviours using unstructured clinical note text from New South Wales (NSW) Ambulance data and compare their performance via traditional methods. METHODS: Primary data were derived from NSW Ambulance electronic medical records (eMRs) for potential self-harm related NSW Ambulance attendances for the period 2013-2019. Data included paramedic clinical notes detailing the nature of the attendance, clinical outcome, and narrative information. We assessed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, F-score, and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) for four algorithms (Support Vector Machine, random forest, decision tree, and logistic regression). RESULTS: The performance of these algorithms was compared using the MCC measure. In a test sample of 3157 ambulance attendances (1349 self-harm related behaviours and 1808 unrelated), the MCC for classification of self-harm related behaviour ranged from +0.681 to +0.730. The Support Vector Machine (sensitivity = 82.7%, specificity = 89.6%, MCC = 0.730) and the logistic regression (sensitivity = 83.1%, specificity = 89.3%, MCC = 0.727) models performed best. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that machine learning models can be applied to paramedic notes within unstructured medical records to classify self-harm related behaviours. The resulting model could be used to compliment current manual abstraction of self-harm behaviours and provide more timely approximations to be used for self-harm surveillance.",10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2022.104734,Algorithms;Ambulances;Australia;*Electronic Health Records;Humans;Machine Learning;New South Wales/epidemiology;Retrospective Studies;*Self-Injurious Behavior/diagnosis/epidemiology;Epidemiology;Natural language processing;Population surveillance;Suicidal behaviour

However, information regarding them is not always collected in healthcare interactions, and healthcare professionals are not always well-trained or equipped to address them. Emergency medical services (EMS) professionals are uniquely positioned to observe and attend to SDoH because of their presence in patients' environments; however, the transmission of that information may be lost during transitions of care. Documentation of SDoH in EMS records may be helpful in identifying and addressing patients' insecurities and improving their health outcomes. Our objective in this study was to determine the presence of SDoH information in adult EMS records and understand how such information is referenced, appraised, and linked to other determinants by EMS personnel. Methods: Using EMS records for adult patients in the 2019 ESO Data Collaborative public-use research dataset using a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm, we identified free-text narratives containing documentation of at least one SDoH from categories associated with food, housing, employment, insurance, financial, and social support insecurities. From the NLP corpus, we randomly selected 100 records from each of the SDoH categories for qualitative content analysis using grounded theory. Results: Of the 5,665,229 records analyzed by the NLP algorithm, 175,378 (3.1%) were identified as containing at least one reference to SDoH. References to those SDoH were centered around the social topics of accessibility, mental health, physical health, and substance use. There were infrequent explicit references to other SDoH in the EMS records, but some relationships between categories could be inferred from contexts. Appraisals of patients' employment, food, and housing insecurities were mostly negative. Narratives including social support and financial insecurities were less negatively appraised, while those regarding insurance insecurities were mostly neutral and related to EMS operations and procedures. Conclusion: The social determinants of health are infrequently documented in EMS records. When they are included, they are infrequently explicitly linked to other SDoH categories and are often negatively appraised by EMS professionals. Given their unique position to observe and share patients' SDoH information, EMS professionals should be trained to understand, document, and address SDoH in their practice.",10.5811/westjem.59070,Adult;Humans;*Natural Language Processing;Social Determinants of Health;Algorithms;Documentation;*Emergency Medical Services

The aim of this observational study of emergency calls was to (1) examine whether a machine learning framework (ML) can increase the proportion of calls recognizing OHCA within the first minute compared with dispatchers, (2) present the performance of ML with different false positive rate (FPR) settings, (3) examine call characteristics influencing OHCA recognition. METHODS: ML can be configured with different FPR settings, i.e., more or less inclined to suspect an OHCA depending on the predefined setting. ML OHCA recognition within the first minute is evaluated with a 1.5 FPR as the primary endpoint, and other FPR settings as secondary endpoints. ML was exposed to a random sample of emergency calls from 2018. Voice logs were manually audited to evaluate dispatchers time to recognition. RESULTS: Of 851 OHCA calls, the ML recognized 36% (n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ305) within 1‚ÄØmin compared with 25% (n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ213) by dispatchers. The recognition rate at any time during the call was 86% for ML and 84% for dispatchers, with a median time to recognition of 72 versus 94‚ÄØs. OHCA recognized by both ML and dispatcher showed a 28‚ÄØs mean difference in favour of ML (P‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.001). ML with higher FPR settings reduced recognition times.

By increasing the accuracy of triage more victims could be transported directly to the best suited care facility and be provided optimal care. We hypothesize that On Scene Injury Severity Prediction (OSISP) algorithms, developed utilizing machine learning methods, have potential to improve triage by complementing the field triage protocol. In this study, the accuracy of OSISP algorithms based on the ""National Automotive Sampling System - Crashworthiness Data System"" (NASS-CDS) of crashes involving adult occupants for calendar years 2010-2015 was evaluated. Severe injury was the dependent variable, defined as Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 15. The dataset contained 37873 subjects, whereof 21589 included injury data and were further analyzed. Selection of model predictors was based on potential for injury severity prediction and perceived feasibility of assessment by first responders. We excluded vehicle telemetry data due to the limited availability of these systems in the contemporary vehicle fleet, and because this data is not yet being utilized in prehospital care.

We sought to test the accuracy of various computer algorithms in identifying the glottic opening, creating a tool that could aid successful intubation. METHODS: We collected a convenience sample of providers who each performed ETI 10 times on a mannequin using a video laryngoscope (C-MAC, Karl Storz Corp, Tuttlingen, Germany). We recorded each attempt and reviewed one-second time intervals for the presence or absence of the glottic opening.

This problem may worsen with abnormal situations, e.g., the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Taking this into consideration, this paper presents a first study on the COVID-19 impact on ambulances' TT by analyzing historical data from the Departmental Fire and Rescue Service of the Doubs (SDIS 25), in France, for three hospitals. Because the TTs of SDIS 25 ambulances increased, this paper also calculated and analyzed the number of breakdowns in services, which augmented due to shortage of ambulances that return on service in time. It is, therefore, vital to have a decision-support tool to better reallocate resources by knowing the time EMSs ambulances and personnel will be in use. Thus, this paper proposes a novel two-stage methodology based on machine learning (ML) models to forecast the TT of each ambulance in a given time and hospital. The first stage uses a multivariate model of regularly spaced time series to predict the average TT (AvTT) per hour, which considers temporal variables and external ones (e.g., COVID-19 statistics, weather data). The second stage utilizes a multivariate irregularly spaced time series model, which considers temporal variables of each ambulance departure, type of intervention, external variables, and the previously predicted AvTT as inputs. Four state-of-the-art ML models were considered in this paper, namely, Light Gradient Boosted Machine, Multilayer Perceptron, Long Short-Term Memory, and Prophet. As shown in the results, the proposed methodology provided remarkable results for practical purposes. The AvTT accuracies obtained for the three hospitals were 90.16%, 97.02%, and 93.09%.

METHODS: The proposed AI model combines a convolutional neural network and long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) to predict STEMI on prehospital 12-lead ECGs obtained from mini-12-lead ECG devices equipped in ambulance vehicles in Central Taiwan. Emergency medical technicians (EMTs) from the 14 AI-implemented fire stations performed the on-site 12-lead ECG examinations using the mini portable device. The 12-lead ECG signals were transmitted to the AI center of China Medical University Hospital to classify the recordings as ""STEMI"" or ""Not STEMI"". In 11 non-AI fire stations, the ECG data were transmitted to a secure network and read by available on-line emergency physicians. The response time was defined as the time interval between the ECG transmission and ECG interpretation feedback. RESULTS: Between July 17, 2021, and March 26, 2022, the AI model classified 362 prehospital 12-lead ECGs obtained from 275 consecutive patients who had called the 119 dispatch centers of fire stations in Central Taiwan for symptoms of chest pain or shortness of breath. The AI's response time to the EMTs in ambulance vehicles was 37.2 +/- 11.3 s, which was shorter than the online physicians' response time from 11 other fire stations with no AI implementation (113.2 +/- 369.4 s, P < 0.001) after analyzing another set of 335 prehospital 12-lead ECGs. The evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, specificity, recall, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and F1 score to assess the overall AI performance in the remote detection of STEMI were 0.992, 0.889, 0.994, 0.941, 0.997, and 0.914, respectively. During the study period, the AI model promptly identified 10 STEMI patients who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) with a median contact-to-door time of 18.5 (IQR: 16-20.8) minutes. CONCLUSION: Implementation of an all-day real-time AI-assisted remote detection of STEMI on prehospital 12-lead ECGs in the field is feasible with a high diagnostic accuracy rate. This approach may help minimize preventable delays in contact-to-treatment times for STEMI patients who require PPCI.",10.3389/fcvm.2022.1001982,ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI);artificial intelligence (AI);contact-to-balloon (C2B) time;convolutional neural network and long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM);prehospital 12-lead ECGs

However, the national field triage guidelines proposed by the American College of Surgeons have proven to be relatively insensitive when identifying severe traumas. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to build a prehospital triage model to predict severe trauma and enhance the performance of the national field triage guidelines. METHODS: This was a multisite prediction study, and the data were extracted from the National Trauma Data Bank between 2017 and 2019. All patients with injury, aged 16 years of age or older, and transported by ambulance from the injury scene to any trauma center were potentially eligible. The data were divided into training, internal, and external validation sets of 672,309; 288,134; and 508,703 patients, respectively. As the national field triage guidelines recommended, age, 7 vital signs, and 8 injury patterns at the prehospital stage were included as candidate variables for model development. Outcomes were severe trauma with an Injured Severity Score >/=16 (primary) and critical resource use within 24 hours of emergency department arrival (secondary). The triage model was developed using an extreme gradient boosting model and Shapley additive explanation analysis. The model's accuracy regarding discrimination, calibration, and clinical benefit was assessed. RESULTS: At a fixed specificity of 0.5, the model showed a sensitivity of 0.799 (95% CI 0.797-0.801), an undertriage rate of 0.080 (95% CI 0.079-0.081), and an overtriage rate of 0.743 (95% CI 0.742-0.743) for predicting severe trauma. The model showed a sensitivity of 0.774 (95% CI 0.772-0.776), an undertriage rate of 0.158 (95% CI 0.157-0.159), and an overtriage rate of 0.609 (95% CI 0.608-0.609) when predicting critical resource use, fixed at 0.5 specificity. The triage model's areas under the curve were 0.755 (95% CI 0.753-0.757) for severe trauma prediction and 0.736 (95% CI 0.734-0.737) for critical resource use prediction. The triage model's performance was better than those of the Glasgow Coma Score, Prehospital Index, revised trauma score, and the 2011 national field triage guidelines RED criteria. The model's performance was consistent in the 2 validation sets. CONCLUSIONS: The prehospital triage model is promising for predicting severe trauma and achieving an undertriage rate of <10%.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a machine learning algorithm could detect complex dependencies between clinical variables in emergency departments in OHCA survivors and perform reliable predictions of favorable neurologic outcomes. METHODS: This study included adults (>/=18 years of age) with a sustained return of spontaneous circulation after successful resuscitation from OHCA between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2014. We applied three machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). The primary outcome was a favorable neurological outcome at hospital discharge, defined as a Glasgow-Pittsburgh cerebral performance category of 1 to 2. The secondary outcome was a 30-day survival rate and survival-to-discharge rate. RESULTS: The final analysis included 1071 participants from the study period.

The dispatching accuracy has seldom been addressed in previous studies. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to build a machine learning-based model through text mining of emergency calls for the automated identification of severely injured patients after a road accident. METHODS: Audio recordings of road accidents in Taipei City, Taiwan, in 2018 were obtained and randomly sampled. Data on call transfers or non-Mandarin speeches were excluded. To predict cases of severe trauma identified on-site by emergency medical technicians, all included cases were evaluated by both humans (6 dispatchers) and a machine learning model, that is, a prehospital-activated major trauma (PAMT) model. The PAMT model was developed using term frequency-inverse document frequency, rule-based classification, and a Bernoulli naive Bayes classifier. Repeated random subsampling cross-validation was applied to evaluate the robustness of the model. The prediction performance of dispatchers and the PAMT model, in severe cases, was compared. Performance was indicated by sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy. RESULTS: Although the mean sensitivity and negative predictive value obtained by the PAMT model were higher than those of dispatchers, they obtained higher mean specificity, positive predictive value, and accuracy. The mean accuracy of the PAMT model, from certainty level 0 (lowest certainty) to level 6 (highest certainty), was higher except for levels 5 and 6. The overall performances of the dispatchers and the PAMT model were similar; however, the PAMT model had higher accuracy in cases where the dispatchers were less certain of their judgments. CONCLUSIONS: A machine learning-based model, called the PAMT model, was developed to predict severe road accident trauma. The results of our study suggest that the accuracy of the PAMT model is not superior to that of the participating dispatchers; however, it may assist dispatchers when they lack confidence while making a judgment.",10.2196/30210,Bayes Theorem;*Emergency Medical Dispatch;Emergency Medical Service Communication Systems;*Emergency Medical Services/methods;Humans;Machine Learning;Bernoulli naive Bayes;dispatcher;emergency medical dispatch;emergency medical service;frequency-inverse document frequency;trauma

METHODS: Audio recordings of 337 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest calls from March-April 2011 were retrieved. The callers' emotional state was classified based on the emotional content and cooperative scores. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients extracted essential information from the voice signals. A support vector machine was utilised for the automatic judgement, and repeated random sub-sampling cross validation (RRS-CV) was applied to evaluate robustness. The results from the artificial intelligence classifier were compared with the consensus of expert reviewers. RESULTS: The audio recordings were classified into five emotional content and cooperative score levels. The proposed model had an average positive predictive value of 72.97%, a negative predictive value of 93.47%, sensitivity of 38.76%, and specificity of 98.29%. If only the first 10 seconds of the recordings were considered, it had an average positive predictive value of 84.62%, a negative predictive value of 93.57%, sensitivity of 52.38%, and specificity of 98.64%. The artificial intelligence model's performance maintained preferable results for emotionally stable cases. CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence models can possibly facilitate the judgement of callers' emotional states during dispatch conversations. This model has the potential to be utilised in practice, by pre-screening emotionally stable callers, thus allowing dispatchers to focus on cases that are judged to be emotionally unstable.

However, optimal policies for the dispatch of such drones are not yet known. We sought to develop dispatch rules for a network of defibrillator-carrying drones. METHODS: We identified all suspected OHCAs in Peel Region, Ontario, Canada from Jan. 2015 to Dec. 2019. We developed drone dispatch rules based on the difference between a predicted ambulance response time to a calculated drone response time for each OHCA. Ambulance response times were predicted using linear regression and neural network models, while drone response times were calculated using drone specifications from recent pilot studies and the literature. We evaluated the dispatch rules based on response time performance and dispatch decisions, comparing them to two baseline policies of never dispatching and always dispatching drones. RESULTS: A total of 3573 suspected OHCAs were included in the study with median and mean historical ambulance response times of 5.8 and 6.2‚ÄØmin. All machine learning-based dispatch rules significantly reduced the median response time to 3.9‚ÄØmin and mean response time to 4.1-4.2‚ÄØmin (all P‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.001) and were non-inferior to universally dispatching drones (all P‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.001) while reducing the number of drone flights by up to 30%. Dispatch rules with more drone flights achieved higher sensitivity but lower specificity and accuracy.

Quantitative analysis of the VF electrocardiogram (ECG) can predict patient outcomes and could potentially enable a patient-specific, guided approach to resuscitation. However, VF analysis during resuscitation is confounded by cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) artifact in the ECG, challenging continuous application to guide therapy throughout resuscitation. We therefore sought to design a method to predict VF shock outcomes during CPR. METHODS: Study data included 4577 5-s VF segments collected during and without CPR prior to defibrillation attempts in N = 1151 arrest patients. Using training data (460 patients), an algorithm was designed to predict the VF shock outcomes of defibrillation success (return of organized ventricular rhythm) and functional survival (Cerebral Performance Category 1-2). The algorithm was designed with variable-frequency notch filters to reduce CPR artifact in the ECG based on real-time chest compression rate. Ten ECG features and three dichotomous patient characteristics were developed to predict outcomes. These variables were combined using support vector machines and logistic regression. Algorithm performance was evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to predict outcomes in validation data (691 patients). RESULTS: AUC (95% Confidence Interval) for predicting defibrillation success was 0.74 (0.71-0.77) during CPR and 0.77 (0.74-0.79) without CPR. AUC for predicting functional survival was 0.75 (0.72-0.78) during CPR and 0.76 (0.74-0.79) without CPR. CONCLUSION: A novel algorithm predicted defibrillation success and functional survival during ongoing CPR following VF arrest, providing a potential proof-of-concept towards real-time guidance of resuscitation therapy.",10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.104136,*Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation;Electric Countershock;Electrocardiography;Humans;*Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest/therapy;Ventricular Fibrillation/therapy;Algorithm;Cardiac arrest;Cardiopulmonary resuscitation;Defibrillation;Electrocardiogram;Machine learning;Resuscitation;Ventricular fibrillation

The approach is based on the bat algorithm and convolutional neural network (BA-CNN). It aims to take transfer the patients confidentially, accurately, and quickly. The type of CNN used in this research is a residual network (ResNet). The node method is responsible for creating the city map. In the beginning, information about the accident place is received by the control station and forwarded to both the hospital and the ambulance. The driver feeds the data that contain the ambulance vehicle's node position and the accident location to the BA-CNN vehicle routing algorithm. The algorithm then obtains the shortest path to reach the location of the accident by the driver. When the vehicle arrives at the accident location, the driver updates the algorithm with hospital and accident positions. Then, the shortest path (which leads to the fast reach time) to the hospital is calculated. The bat algorithm provides offline data for a possible combination of different source and destination coordinates. The offline data are then trained by utilizing a neural network. The neural network is used for finding the shortest routes between source and destination. The performance evaluation of the BA-CNN algorithm is based on the following metrics: end-to-end delay (EED), throughput, and packet delivery fraction (PDF). This BA-CNN is compared with counterparts, including three different existing methods such as TBM, TVR, and SAODV. The experiments demonstrate that the PDF of our method is 0.90 for 10 malicious nodes, which is higher than in the TBM, TVR, and SAODV. ¬© 2022 Taha Darwassh Hanawy Hussein et al.",10.1155/2022/7339647,Accidents;Ambulances;Convolution;Convolutional neural networks;Hospitals;Location;Routing algorithms;Smart city;Accident location;Bat algorithms;Convolutional neural network;Neural networks algorithms;Neural-networks;Offline data;Packet Delivery;Routing approach;Short-path;Sources and destinations;Graph theory

This framework is applicable, among others, to the post-disaster ambulance bus routing problem, where an ambulance bus must pick up (urgent) patients at geographically dispersed locations and bring them to a centrally-located hospital as quickly as possible. Solving the DVDPHC requires a dynamic decision-making rule at each decision moment for which demands to serve at the current location, and where to direct the vehicle next. We propose a heuristic based on approximate dynamic programming combined with a neural network (ADP-NN) for effectively solving the DVDPHC. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed method is fast, scalable and robust.

However, not all ED consultations are necessary. For example, 80% of patients in the ED with chest pain do not have an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Artificial intelligence (AI) is useful in analyzing (medical) data, and might aid health care workers in prehospital clinical decision-making before patients are presented to the hospital. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop an AI model which would be able to predict ACS before patients visit the ED. The model retrospectively analyzed prehospital data acquired by emergency medical services' nurse paramedics. METHODS: Patients presenting to the emergency medical services with symptoms suggestive of ACS between September 2018 and September 2020 were included. An AI model using a supervised text classification algorithm was developed to analyze data. Data were analyzed for all 7458 patients (mean 68, SD 15 years, 54% men). Specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for control and intervention groups. At first, a machine learning (ML) algorithm (or model) was chosen; afterward, the features needed were selected and then the model was tested and improved using iterative evaluation and in a further step through hyperparameter tuning. Finally, a method was selected to explain the final AI model. RESULTS: The AI model had a specificity of 11% and a sensitivity of 99.5% whereas usual care had a specificity of 1% and a sensitivity of 99.5%. The PPV of the AI model was 15% and the NPV was 99%. The PPV of usual care was 13% and the NPV was 94%. CONCLUSIONS: The AI model was able to predict ACS based on retrospective data from the prehospital setting. It led to an increase in specificity (from 1% to 11%) and NPV (from 94% to 99%) when compared to usual care, with a similar sensitivity. Due to the retrospective nature of this study and the singular focus on ACS it should be seen as a proof-of-concept. Other (possibly life-threatening) diagnoses were not analyzed. Future prospective validation is necessary before implementation.",10.2196/51375,Hollands Midden Acute Regional Triage-cardiology;acute coronary syndrome;algorithm;angina;artificial intelligence;cardiology;clinical decision-making;emergency department;emergency medical service;natural language processing;overcrowding;paramedics;prehospital;triage

Their management requires a balance to be found between available resources and the actual needs of the requesting party. Those regarding suicidal behaviour, which are resource heavy, are few in number in terms of the bulk of requests, and detecting them correctly is therefore important. Previous research, using machine learning algorithms to analyse suicide, has typically focused on discovering insights to be used by medical personnel. This proposal extends its use in two directions: knowledge that can be used by non-exclusively medical staff, such as telephone operators, and the models that have been incorporated into a software prototype to help in the decision-making of an emergency department. In addition, previous research has often included a range of information from different sources that are not available when processing an emergency call request, for example, data that is only obtained at the end of the intervention. A full-scale data mining process has been performed using data from the out-of-hospital emergency service in Malaga (Spain). Sensitivity has been the primary goal to avoid missing cases requiring special attention, but this objective has been pursued without overlooking a good trade-off with specificity. The best models can offer such a compromise between sensitivity and specificity, and show more than 80% in both metrics simultaneously. The experts validate that the modelling phase showed that the algorithms have automatically identified already known situations. This lays the groundwork for further iterations with a promising outlook. ¬© 2024 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.engappai.2024.108910,Class-imbalanced data;Emergency calls;Mental health disorders;Suicidal behaviour detection;Supervised learning;Support clinical decision-making;Data mining;Decision making;Economic and social effects;Emergency rooms;Learning algorithms;Machine learning;Software prototyping;Behavior detection;Clinical decision making;Health disorders;Imbalanced data;Mental health;Mental health disorder;Suicidal behavior detection;Emergency services

A considerable amount of spatial optimization research has been devoted to the development of models to support location planning in the context of EMS, with extensive applications in policy making around the world. However, in China, studies on the location of EMS facilities have not been paid enough attention to, let alone their practical applications. This paper conducted location optimization for EMS facilities in Chengdu, one of the biggest cities in southwest China with more than 16.5 million population, aiming to optimize the EMS system by adding (upgrading) a minimum number of EMS facilities to achieve a given population coverage. METHODS: Location optimization was conducted according to regional health policy goal for the EMS system in Chengdu, China, 2017. The nearest-neighbor approach was used to calculate the shortest travel time based on geographical information system (GIS). The location set covering model was used to formulate the optimization problem under China's context, and genetic algorithm (GA) was employed to determine the optimized locations. RESULTS: The results showed that a minimum number of 55 new facilities were required to upgrade to EMS facilities to achieve the policy goal of 90% population coverage of EMS within 15 minutes. Access to EMS also improved substantially in terms of shortest travel time after facility upgrading. The weighted median shortest travel time to EMS facilities in Chengdu decreased by 14.57%, from 6.45 minutes to 5.51 minutes. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the solution could effectively achieve the policy goal of population coverage with a minimum number of new EMS facilities. Our findings would support evidence-based decision-making in future EMS planning in China.",10.2147/RMHP.S304475,EMS location;emergency medical care;genetic algorithm;location set covering problem

Instead of dispatching ambulances only at the time of demand, pre-positioning them can reduce the response time and provide prompt medical attention. Deep learning techniques hold great potential and have proven to be essential for problem-solving and decision-making in the field of healthcare services. This study introduces a deep-embedded clustering-based approach to predict optimal locations for ambulance positing. Various factors and patterns in a geographical region greatly influence the occurrence of road crashes, hence understanding such relationships while model building is crucial. The present study also emphasizes the need of preserving such patterns during model building to ensure real-time results and implements them with the help of another deep-learning-based model, Cat2Vec. The proposed framework is also compared with traditional clustering algorithms like K-means, GMM, and Agglomerative clustering. Moreover, to calculate response time and distance in real time, a novel scoring function has also been introduced for the performance evaluation of various algorithms. The proposed ambulance-positing system exhibits remarkable performance, achieving an accuracy of 95% with k-fold cross-validation and a novel distance score of 7.581 proving the use of the proposed approach is better than all the other traditional algorithms used.",10.1109/Access.2023.3284993,deep embedded clustering (dec);cat2vec;k-means;ambulance positioning;accident hotspots;severity prediction;classification

However, the new challenges faced by EMS dispatchers during video-guided CPR (V-CPR)‚Äîsuch as analyzing the video stream, providing feedback to the caller, and managing stress‚Äîdemand innovative solutions. This study explores the feasibility of incorporating an open-source ‚Äúmachine-learning‚Äù tool (artificial intelligence ‚Äì AI), to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy in correctly detecting the actual compression frequency and compression depth in video footage of a simulated CPR. Design: MediaPipe Pose Landmark Detection (Google LLC, Mountain View, CA, USA), an open-source AI software using ‚Äúmachine-learning‚Äù models to detect human bodies in images and videos, was programmed to assess compression frequency an depth in nine videos, showing CPR on a resuscitation manikin. Compression frequency and depth were assessed from compression to compression with AI software and were compared to the manikin's internal software (QCPR, Laerdal, Stavanger, Norway). After testing for Gaussian distribution, means of non-gaussian data were compared using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test and the Bland Altman method. Main results: MediaPipe Pose Landmark Detection successfully identified and tracked the person performing CPR in all nine video sequences. There were high levels of agreement between compression frequencies derived from AI and manikin's software. However, the precision of compression depth showed major inaccuracies and was overall not accurate. Conclusions: This feasibility study demonstrates the potential of open-source ‚Äúmachine-learning‚Äù tools in providing real-time feedback on V-CPR video sequences. In this pilot study, an open-source landmark detection AI software was able to assess CPR compression frequency with high agreement to actual frequency derived from the CPR manikin. For compression depth, its performance was not accurate, suggesting the need for adjustment. Since the software used is currently not intended for medical use, further development is necessary before the technology can be evaluated in real CPR. ¬© 2024 The Authors",10.1016/j.resplu.2024.100825,AI;Artificial Intelligence;Body-tracking;Cardiopulmonary resuscitation;CPR;EMS Dispatching;Machine Learning;ML;Pose-tracking;T-CPR;Telephone assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation;V-CPR;Video-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation

Currently algorithms discriminate circulation (pulsed rhythms, PR) from no circulation (pulseless electrical activity, PEA), but PEA can be classified into true (TPEA) and pseudo (PPEA) depending on cardiac contractility. This study introduces multi-class algorithms to automatically determine circulation states during OHCA using the signals available in defibrillators. METHODS: A cohort of 60 OHCA cases were used to extract a dataset of 2506 5-s segments, labeled as PR (1463), PPEA (364) and TPEA (679) using the invasive blood pressure, experimentally recorded through a radial/femoral cannulation. A multimodal algorithm using features obtained from the electrocardiogram, the thoracic impedance and the capnogram was designed. A random forest model was trained to discriminate three (TPEA/PPEA/PR) and two (PEA/PR) circulation states. The models were evaluated using repeated patient-wise 5-fold cross-validation, with the unweighted mean of sensitivities (UMS) and F (1)-score as performance metrics. RESULTS: The best model for 3-class had a median (interquartile range, IQR) UMS and F (1) of 69.0% (68.0-70.1) and 61.7% (61.0-62.5), respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: The first multiclass OHCA circulation state classifier was demonstrated. The method improved previous algorithms for binary pulse/no-pulse decisions.

It discusses the disparities in precision rates between subjective evaluations by health professionals with objective assessments of AI systems. MATERIAL AND METHOD: For the analysis of the efficacy of emergency triage; 50 virtual patient scenarios had been created. Emergency medicine residents and other healthcare providers who had triage education were tasked with categorizing triage levels for virtual patient scenarios. Also artificial intelligence systems, tasked for resolving the same scenarios. All of them were asked to use three color-coded triage of the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Health. The answer keys were created by consensus of the researchers. In addition, Emergency medicine specialists were asked to evaluate the acuity level of each scenario in order to perform sub-analyses. RESULTS: The study consisted of 86 healthcare professionals, comprising 31 Emergency medicine residents (26.5%), 1 paramedic (0.9%), 5 emergency health technicians (4.3%), and 80 nurses (68.4%). Google Bard AI and OpenAI Chat GPT v.3.5 were used as artificial intelligence systems. The responses compared with the answer key to determine each groups efficacy. As planned the responses from healthcare professionals were analyzed individually for acuity level of scenarios. Emergency medicine residents and other groups of healthcare providers had significantly higher numbers of correct answers compared to Google Bard and Chat GPT (n=30.7 vs n=25.5). There was no significant difference between ChatGPT and Bard for low and high acuity scenarios (p=0.821)CONCLUSION: AI models can examine extensive data sets and make more accurate and quicker triage judgments with sophisticated algorithms. However, in this study, we found that the triage ability of artificial intelligence is not as sufficient as humans. A more efficient triage system can be developed by integrating artificial intelligence with human input, rather than solely relying on technology (Tab. 4, Ref. 41).

METHOD: Between 15th June and 1st August 2023, 210 patients in Qatar, treated by Hamad Medical Corporation Ambulance Service (HMCAS) but refusing transportation to hospital, were interviewed. Key outcome variables stratified by demographics included ""reasons for refusing transport,"" ""satisfaction with HMCAS service,"" and ""postrefusal actions."" Responses underwent sentiment analysis and topic modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation. Machine learning models, such as Naive Bayes, K-nearest neighboring, random forest, and support vector machine, were used to predict patients' subsequent actions. RESULTS: Participants had an average age of 38.61 +/- 19.91 years. The chief complaints were primarily chest and abdominal pains (18.49%; n = 39). Sentiment Analysis revealed a generally favorable perception of HMCAS-provided service. Latent Dirichlet allocation identified two main topics pertaining to refusal reasons and service satisfaction. Naive Bayes and support vector machine algorithms were most effective in predicting postrefusal actions with an accuracy rate of 81.58%.

Given the impact of these diseases, there is a strong prehospital focus on early identification, treatment and transport of patients with acute coronary syndrome. The main aim of the STEMI system of care is to reduce the time to reperfusion of the myocardium, thereby improving morbidity and mortality rates. Therefore, the identification of STEMI by paramedics can have a dramatic effect on patients' long-term health outcomes. Ambulance Victoria paramedics play a crucial role in the care provided to AMI patients across the state, with the assistance of a computer-automated interpretation of 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) to aid STEMI identification. Objectives: This study's objective is to analyse the diagnostic capability of the computer-automated interpretation to diagnose STEMI in the out-of-hospital setting. Methods: Quantitative data from January 2018 to December 2019 was sourced from the Victorian Ambulance STEMI Quality Initiative. These data were periodically matched with hospital outcome and diagnosis data from the Victorian Cardiac Outcomes Registry to compare provisional paramedic diagnoses with the final hospital diagnoses. Results: Of the 5269 cases of suspected STEMI, 765 (14.5%) could be matched with outcome data. Of these 765 cases, 88.9% were correctly identified as STEMI. The remaining 10% were categorised as either non-STEMI or unstable angina. No data were available for 1.1%. Conclusions: The diagnostic capability of the Zoll Inovise 12L interpretive algorithm to diagnose STEMI in the out-of-hospital setting appears safe and feasible. However, because of limited data matching paramedic findings with patient outcomes in hospital, no hard conclusions can be drawn. Furthermore, there is no way to ascertain how many false positives the Zoll monitor is interpreting. Further investigation is required to assess the true diagnostic capability of the Zoll Inovise 12L interpretive algorithm.",10.12968/jpar.2022.14.9.366,"ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction;Diagnosis;Predictive Value of Tests;Prehospital Care;Victoria;Signal Processing, Computer Assisted;Electrocardiography;Methods;Algorithms;Human;Ambulances;Emergency Medical Technicians;Victoria;Quantitative Studies;Resource Databases;Early Diagnosis;Early Intervention;Outcomes (Health Care);Retrospective Design;Descriptive Research;Prospective Studies;Male;Female;Middle Age;Aged;Data Analysis Software;Descriptive Statistics;Professional Development"

The cooperation becomes necessary, particularly where the air ambulance can not land at the accident scene, and it sometimes seems essential to make use of transfer points during the cooperation. Given that the demand pattern might change during time, it does not seem logical to formulate the problem statically. Hence, in this paper, we have presented a multi-period maximal coverage location model, which simultaneously locates the transfer points, ground ambulance stations, air ambulance stations, and allocates ambulances to them. Also, the available ambulances are moved among the established stations if required subject to demand changes during the planning horizon. Coverage is provided based on the times it takes the ambulance to arrive at the accident scene and to transfer from the accident scene to the nearest treatment center. In this research, four methods of providing service to the injured and transferring them to treatment centers have been considered. In the presented model, the inaccessibility of ambulances has been considered in light of the notion of backup coverage. Given the complexity of the problem and the impossibility to solve it optimally at large-scale problems, a heuristic algorithm with the greedy approach has been presented for solving it. The obtained computational results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in solving different problems as compared to CPLEX. ¬© 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s12652-020-02230-5,Air ambulance stations;Demand pattern change;Emergency medical services;Ground ambulance stations;Transfer point location;Accidents;Ambulances;Computational efficiency;Heuristic algorithms;Backup coverages;Computational results;Coverage models;Greedy approaches;Large-scale problem;Location modeling;Planning horizons;Emergency services

Inversely proportional to their performance, most machine learning models generally suffer from the lack of explainability, especially the local explainability of the model, that is, the case-specific explainability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this paper, we proposed a GBDT (Gradient Boosting Decision Tree)-based explainable model for case-specific paramedical diagnostics, and mainly make the following contributions: (1) an adaptive gradient boosting decision tree (AdaGBDT) model is proposed to boost the path-mining for decision effectively; (2) to learn a case-specific feature importance embedding for a specific patient, the bi-side mutual information is applied to characterize the backtracking on the decision path; (3) through the collaborative decision-making by globally explainable AdaGBDT with case-based reasoning (CBR) in the case-specific metric space, some hard cases can be identified by the means of visualized interpretation. The performance of our model is evaluated on the Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset and the UCI heart disease dataset. RESULTS: Experiments conducted on two datasets show that our AdaGBDT achieves the best performance, with the F1-value of 0.9647 and 0.8405 respectively. Moreover, a series of experimental analyses and case studies further illustrate the excellent performance of feature importance embedding.

Since chest compressions induce severe motion artifact in the electro-cardiogram (ECG), current automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) instruct the user not to perform CPR during the rhythm analysis period. However, performing continuous CPR is vital and dramatically increases the chance of survival. Hence, we demonstrate a novel application of a deep convolutional neural network encoder-decoder (CNNED) method to suppress CPR artifact in near real-time, using only ECG data. The encoder portion of the CNNED uses the magnitude and phase contents derived via time-varying spectral analysis to learn distinct features that are representative of both the ECG signal and CPR artifact. The decoder portion takes the results from the encoder and reconstructs what is perceived as the motion artifact-removed ECG data. These procedures are done via a multitude of training of the CNNED using many different arrhythmias contaminated with CPR. In this study, CPR-contaminated ECGs were generated by combining clean ECGs with 52 different CPR artifacts. ECG data from CUDB, VFDB, SDDB, and AFDB datasets which belong to the Physionet's Physiobank archive were used to create the training set containing 14-second ECG segments. The performance of the proposed CNNED was evaluated on a separate test set comprised of 23,816 CPR-contaminated 14-second ECG segments from 458 subjects. The results were evaluated by three metrics: signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), correlation coefficient, and accuracy of Defibtech's AED shock advisory algorithm (SAA). CNNED resulted in an increase of the mean SNR value from-3 dB to 7.5 dB and 7.1 dB for shockable and non-shockable rhythms, respectively. 80.85% of the filtered shockable and 74.13% of the filtered non-shockable ECG data were highly correlated (> 0.7) with the artifact-free ECG; these values were only 13.30% and 12.71% for CPR-contaminated shockable and non -shockable, respectively, without our filtering approach. Comparing results of Defibtech's AED SAA before and after applying CNNED on the CPR-contaminated ECG, the specificity improved from 96.21% to 99.14% for normal sinus rhythm, and from 88.5% to 96.45% for other non-shockable rhythms. The sensitivity of shockable detection also increased from 67.68% to 90.90% for ventricular fibrillation, and from 62.71% to 82.26% for ventricular tachycardia.

Ambulance personnel should take steps to reduce these vibrations. To avoid slowdowns and other barriers that create high vibration peaks, the speed is reduced or the ambulance deviates from the quicker or shorter path. This work implements Artificial Neural Network (ANN) control over five low-cost active shock absorbers proposed to decreasing the impact of vibration on a patient's body during an ambulance ride. For this, the passive shock absorber is replaced by a new actuator consisting of a conventional hydraulic cylinder with a proportional butterfly valve placed outside the cylinder between its orifices. The ANN is used to adjust the damping coefficient. The ANN controller inputs are the accelerations of the sprung and unsprung masses, and the output is the valve opening area. Two forces may be exerted by this active suspension system: one is used to compensate for the mass of the stretcher, the patient and the medical equipment if present and a second is used to actively isolate the patient from the vibrations of the ambulance. The performance of the active suspension ambulance is contrasted to that of a traditional ambulance, in which the stretcher is rigidly linked to the ambulance body. When compared to alternative controllers, the findings showed that the proposed register controlled by ANN performed better. The simulations demonstrate that the active system may minimize the vibrations of the patient's mass and the stretcher by more than 70% for random abnormalities in the road that meet the ISO2631-5 and ISO 8608 standards.",10.1177/09544070221075456,

This growth is further accentuated by an imbalance in the allocation of emergency facilities, amplifying public anxiety and underscoring the urgent necessity for scientifically informed optimization of pre-hospital emergency facilities. To this end, the present study articulates specific optimization goals for facility deployment and introduces a nuanced set coverage optimization model that integrates spatiotemporal determinants of emergency service requirements. The model is fortified with a constellation of constraints, including spatial constraint, temporal constraint, and coverage constraint. For spatial constraints, we use the Monte Carlo simulation to predict the spatial distribution of emergency demands. Temporal constraints involve determining the actual travel time matrix from predicted demand points to candidate sites. Coverage constraints specify the effective demand coverage rate. This study uses Nanjing as a case example, utilizing multisource big data, including ambulance GPS logs from June 2016 to May 2017, Amap traffic congestion indicators, and survey data on existing emergency facilities in Nanjing City. By preprocessing and analyzing the existing data, this study thoroughly investigates the spatiotemporal distribution of emergency demands and the impact of traffic congestion on emergency service effectiveness. Consequently, the model incorporates constraints that ensure, under the specified planning and actual traffic conditions, 95 % of the simulated emergency demands can be met within an 8-minute on-route time. Locations for pre-hospital emergency stations are optimized using a genetic algorithm, achieving the best solution at the 120th iteration. Verification confirms 134 optimal sites; after excluding 52 existing sites, 82 potential sites are identified. The new layout plan has reduced Nanjing's average emergency response time from 18.6 min to 12 min. Additionally, under peak and average traffic conditions, emergency demand coverage rates improved from 76.92 % and 83.18 % at 15 min to 95.61 % and 98.10 % at 12 min, respectively.

Using data from the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES), and machine learning (ML) techniques, we developed a model of neurological outcome prediction for OHCA in Chicago, Illinois. METHODS: Rescue workflow data of 2639 patients with witnessed OHCA were retrieved from Chicago's CARES. An Embedded Fully Convolutional Network (EFCN) classification model was selected to predict the patient outcome (survival with good neurological outcomes or not) based on 27 input features with the objective of maximizing the average class sensitivity. Using this model, sensitivity analysis of intervention variables such as bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), targeted temperature management, and coronary angiography was conducted. RESULTS: The EFCN classification model has an average class sensitivity of 0.825. Sensitivity analysis of patient outcome shows that an additional 33 patients would have survived with good neurological outcome if they had received lay person CPR in addition to CPR by emergency medical services and 88 additional patients would have survived if they had received the coronary angiography intervention. CONCLUSIONS: ML modeling of the complex Chicago OHCA rescue system can predict neurologic outcomes with a reasonable level of accuracy and can be used to support intervention decisions such as CPR or coronary angiography.

However, there remain significant research gaps on the utilization of ML models for decision-making and their impact on survival outcomes. The purpose of this study was to develop ML models that effectively predict hospital's practice to perform coronary angiography (CA) in adult patients after OHCA and subsequent neurologic outcomes. METHODS: We utilized all (N = 2398) patients treated by the Chicago Fire Department Emergency Medical Services included in the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) between 2013 and 2018 who survived to hospital admission to develop, test, and analyze ML models for decisions after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and patient survival. ML classification models, including the Embedded Fully Convolutional Network (EFCN) model, were compared based on their ability to predict post-ROSC decisions and survival. RESULTS: The EFCN classification model achieved the best results across tested ML algorithms. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for CA and Survival were 0.908 and 0.896 respectively. Through cohort analyses, our model predicts that 18.3% (CI 16.4-20.2) of patients should receive a CA that did not originally, and 30.1% (CI 28.5-31.7) of these would experience improved survival outcomes.

Accordingly, prehospital management of pediatric asthma exacerbations has been designated an EMS research priority. However, accurate identification of pediatric asthma exacerbations from the prehospital record is nuanced and difficult due to the heterogeneity of asthma symptoms, especially in children. Therefore, this study's objective was to develop a prehospital-specific pediatric asthma computable phenotype (CP) that could accurately identify prehospital encounters for pediatric asthma exacerbations. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study of patient encounters for ages 2-18 years from the ESO Data Collaborative between 2018 and 2021. We modified two existing rule-based pediatric asthma CPs and created three new CPs (one rule-based and two machine learning-based). Two pediatric emergency medicine physicians independently reviewed encounters to assign labels of asthma exacerbation or not. Taking that labeled encounter data, a 50/50 train/test split was used to create training and test sets from the labeled data. A 90/10 split was used to create a small validation set from the training set. We used specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and macro F(1) to compare performance across all CP models. RESULTS: After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 24,283 patient encounters remained. The machine-learning models exhibited the best performance for the identification of pediatric asthma exacerbations. A multi-layer perceptron-based model had the best performance in all metrics, with an F(1) score of 0.95, specificity of 1.00, sensitivity of 0.91, negative predictive value of 0.98, and positive predictive value of 1.00. CONCLUSION: We modified existing and developed new pediatric asthma CPs to retrospectively identify prehospital pediatric asthma exacerbation encounters. We found that machine learning-based models greatly outperformed rule-based models. Given the high performance of the machine-learning models, the development and application of machine learning-based CPs for other conditions and diseases could help accelerate EMS research and ultimately enhance clinical care by accurately identifying patients with conditions of interest.",10.1080/10903127.2024.2352583,

Natural language processing (NLP) could identify new factors from unstructured data using free-text narratives. The purpose of this study was to use NLP to examine EMS clinician free-text narratives for characteristics associated with prehospital ROSC in pediatric OHCA. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of patients ages 0-17 with OHCA in 2019 from the ESO Data Collaborative. We performed an exploratory analysis of EMS narratives using NLP with an a priori token library. We then constructed biostatistical and machine learning models and compared their performance in predicting ROSC. RESULTS: There were 1,726 included EMS encounters for pediatric OHCA; 60% were male patients, and the median age was 1 year (IQR 0-9). Most cardiac arrest events (61.3%) were unwitnessed, 87.3% were identified as having medical causes, and 5.9% had initial shockable rhythms. Prehospital ROSC was achieved in 23.1%. Words most positively correlated with ROSC were ""ROSC"" (r = 0.42), ""pulse"" (r = 0.29), ""drowning"" (r = 0.13), and ""PEA"" (r = 0.12). Words negatively correlated with ROSC included ""asystole"" (r = -0.25), ""lividity"" (r = -0.14), and ""cold"" (r = -0.14). The terms ""asystole,"" ""pulse,"" ""no breathing,"" ""PEA,"" and ""dry"" had the greatest difference in frequency of appearance between encounters with and without ROSC (p < 0.05). The best-performing model for predicting prehospital ROSC was logistic regression with random oversampling using free-text data only (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.92). CONCLUSIONS: EMS clinician free-text narratives reveal additional characteristics associated with prehospital ROSC in pediatric OHCA. Incorporating those terms into machine learning models of prehospital ROSC improves predictive ability. Therefore, NLP holds promise as a tool for use in predictive models with the goal to increase evidence-based management of pediatric OHCA.",10.1080/10903127.2022.2074180,Humans;Male;Child;Infant;Female;Retrospective Studies;*Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation;*Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest/therapy;Return of Spontaneous Circulation;Natural Language Processing;*Emergency Medical Services

In Northwestern Ontario (NWO), Canada, communities are widespread with several hospitals offering various diagnostic equipment and services. Thus, resources are limited, and health care providers must often transfer patients with stroke to different hospital locations to ensure the most appropriate care access within recommended time frames. However, health care providers frequently situated temporarily (locum) in NWO or providing care remotely from other areas of Ontario may lack sufficient information and experience in the region to access care for a patient with a time-sensitive condition. Suboptimal decision-making may lead to multiple transfers before definitive stroke care is obtained, resulting in poor outcomes and additional health care system costs. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a tool to inform and assist NWO health care providers in determining the best transfer options for patients with stroke to provide the most efficient care access. We aimed to develop an app using a comprehensive geomapping navigation and estimation system based on machine learning algorithms. This app uses key stroke-related timelines including the last time the patient was known to be well, patient location, treatment options, and imaging availability at different health care facilities. METHODS: Using historical data (2008-2020), an accurate prediction model using machine learning methods was developed and incorporated into a mobile app. These data contained parameters regarding air (Ornge) and land medical transport (3 services), which were preprocessed and cleaned. For cases in which Ornge air services and land ambulance medical transport were both involved in a patient transport process, data were merged and time intervals of the transport journey were determined. The data were distributed for training (35%), testing (35%), and validation (30%) of the prediction model. RESULTS: In total, 70,623 records were collected in the data set from Ornge and land medical transport services to develop a prediction model. Various learning models were analyzed; all learning models perform better than the simple average of all points in predicting output variables. The decision tree model provided more accurate results than the other models. The decision tree model performed remarkably well, with the values from testing, validation, and the model within a close range. This model was used to develop the ""NWO Navigate Stroke"" system. The system provides accurate results and demonstrates that a mobile app can be a significant tool for health care providers navigating stroke care in NWO, potentially impacting patient care and outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The NWO Navigate Stroke system uses a data-driven, reliable, accurate prediction model while considering all variations and is simultaneously linked to all required acute stroke management pathways and tools.

VF waveform was quantified using amplitude spectrum area (AMSA) from defibrillator's ECG recordings prior to each shock. Combinations of AMSA with previous shock index (PSI) or/and change of AMSA (DeltaAMSA) between successive shocks were exercised through a training dataset including 255shocks from 99patientswith neural networks. Performance of the combination methods were compared with AMSA based single feature prediction by area under receiver operating characteristic curve(AUC), sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and prediction accuracy (PA) through a validation dataset that was consisted of 273 shocks from 100patients. RESULTS: A total of61 (61.0%) patients required subsequent shocks (N = 173) in the validation dataset.

This study was conducted to develop and validate a simple scoring rule that could predict survival to hospital discharge at the time of ED arrival. METHODS: This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study based on a nationwide registry (Korean Cardiac Arrest Research Consortium) of out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The study included adult OHCA patients older than 18 years old, who visited one of 33 tertiary hospitals in South Korea from September 1st, 2015 to June 30th, 2020. Among 12,321 screened, 5471 patients were deemed suitable for analysis after exclusion. Pre-hospital ROSC, pre-hospital witness, shockable rhythm, initial pH, and age were selected as the independent variables. The dependent variable was set to be the survival to hospital discharge. Multivariable logistic regression (LR) was performed, and the beta-coefficients were rounded to the nearest integer to formulate the scoring rule. Several machine learning algorithms including the random forest classifier (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and K-nearest neighbor classifier (K-NN) were also trained via 5-fold cross-validation over a pre-specified grid, and validated on the test data. The prediction performances and the calibration curves of each model were obtained. Pre-processing of the registry was done using R, model training & optimization using Python. RESULTS: A total of 5471 patients were included in the analysis. The AUROC of the scoring rule over the test data was 0.7620 (0.7311-0.7929).

METHODS: We used the Swedish Registry for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation to study all out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) cases in Sweden from 2010 to 2020. We had 393 candidate predictors describing the circumstances at cardiac arrest, critical time intervals, patient demographics, initial presentation, spatiotemporal data, socioeconomic status, medications, and comorbidities before arrest. To develop, evaluate and test an array of prediction models, we created stratified (on the outcome measure) random samples of our study population. We created a training set (60% of data), evaluation set (20% of data), and test set (20% of data). We assessed the 30-day survival and cerebral performance category (CPC) score at discharge using several machine learning frameworks with hyperparameter tuning. Parsimonious models with the top 1 to 20 strongest predictors were tested. We calibrated the decision threshold to assess the cut-off yielding 95% sensitivity for survival. The final model was deployed as a web application. FINDINGS: We included 55,615 cases of OHCA. Initial presentation, prehospital interventions, and critical time intervals variables were the most important. At a sensitivity of 95%, specificity was 89%, positive predictive value 52%, and negative predictive value 99% in test data to predict 30-day survival. The area under the receiver characteristic curve was 0.97 in test data using all 393 predictors or only the ten most important predictors. The final model showed excellent calibration. The web application allowed for near-instantaneous survival calculations.

This study aimed to develop and validate a machine learning-based outcome prediction model for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with initial shockable rhythm, which can be used on patient's arrival at the hospital. METHODS: Data were obtained from a nationwide out-of-hospital cardiac arrest registry in Japan. Of 43,350 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients with initial shockable rhythm registered between 2013 and 2017, patients aged <18 years and those with cardiac arrest caused by external factors were excluded. Subjects were classified into training (n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ23,668, 2013-2016 data) and test (n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ6381, data from 2017) sets for validation. Only 19 prehospital variables were used for the outcome prediction. The primary outcome was death at 1 month or survival with poor neurological function (cerebral performance category 3-5; ""poor"" outcome).

Development of novel treatments requires fundamental clinical studies, but access to the true initial rhythm has been a limiting factor. METHODS: Using demographics and detailed clinical variables, we trained and tested an AI model (extreme gradient boosting) to differentiate PEA-SCA versus VF-SCA in a novel setting that provided the true initial rhythm. A subgroup of SCAs are witnessed by emergency medical services personnel, and because the response time is zero, the true SCA initial rhythm is recorded. The internal cohort consisted of 421 emergency medical services-witnessed out-of-hospital SCAs with PEA or VF as the initial rhythm in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area. External validation was performed in 220 emergency medical services-witnessed SCAs from Ventura, CA. RESULTS: In the internal cohort, the artificial intelligence model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.61-0.76).

It deals with injuries and their requests for saving. Therefore, the main aim of the ambulance routing problem is to determine the minimum (i.e., optimum) required distances of between: 1) accident places and the ambulance station; 2) the location of the nearest hospital and the accident places. Although of the efforts proposed in the literature, determining the optimum route is crucial. Therefore, this article seeks to tackle ambulance vehicle routing in smart cities using Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm. It attempts to take the victims as quickly as possible and confidently. Several engineering optimization problems confirm that HHO outperforms many well-known Swarm intelligence approaches. In our system, let‚Äôs use the node approach to produce a city map. Initially, the control station receives accident site information and sends it to the hospital and the ambulance. The HHO vehicle routing algorithm receives data from the driver; the data includes the location of the accident and the node position of the ambulance vehicle. Then, the driver‚Äôs shortest route to the accident scene by the HHO. The locations of the accident and hospital are updated by the driver once the car reaches the accident site. The fastest route (which results in the least travel time) to the hospital is then determined. The HHO can provide offline information for a potential combination of the coordinates of destination and source. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrated that the HHO can provide optimal solutions. Furthermore, performance evaluation experiments demonstrated the superiority of the HHO algorithm over its counterparts (SAODV, TVR, and TBM methods). Furthermore, for ten malicious nodes, the PDF of the algorithm was 0.91, which is higher than the counterparts ¬© 2023, Authors.

Piston-driven mechanical compression devices are frequently used to deliver CPR. The objective of this paper was to design a method to accurately diagnose the rhythm during compressions delivered by a piston-driven device. METHODS: Data was gathered from 230 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients treated with the LUCAS 2 mechanical CPR device. The dataset comprised 201 shockable and 844 nonshockable ECG segments, whereof 270 were asystole (AS) and 574 organized rhythm (OR). A multistage algorithm (MSA) was designed, which included two artifact filters based on a recursive least squares algorithm, a rhythm analysis algorithm from a commercial defibrillator, and an ECG-slope-based rhythm classifier. Data was partitioned randomly and patient-wise into training (60%) and test (40%) for optimization and validation, and statistically meaningful results were obtained repeating the process 500 times. RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation) sensitivity (SE) for shockable rhythms, specificity (SP) for nonshockable rhythms, and the total accuracy of the MSA solution were: 91.7 (6.0), 98.1 (1.1), and 96.9 (0.9), respectively. The SP for AS and OR were 98.0 (1.7) and 98.1 (1.4), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The SE/SP were above the 90%/95% values recommended by the American Heart Association for shockable and nonshockable rhythms other than sinus rhythm, respectively.

OHCA rhythms are grouped into five categories: ventricular fibrillation (VF) and tachycardia (VT), asystole (AS), pulseless electrical activity (PEA), and pulse-generating rhythms (PR). Clinically these rhythms are grouped into broader categories like shockable (VF/VT), non-shockable (AS/PEA/PR), or organized (ORG, PEA/PR). OHCA rhythm classification is further complicated because EKGs are corrupted by cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) artifacts. The objective of this study was to demonstrate a framework for automatic multiclass OHCA rhythm classification in the presence of CPR artifacts. In total, 2133 EKG segments from 272 OHCA patients were used: 580 AS, 94 PR, 953 PEA, 479 VF, and 27 VT. CPR artifacts were adaptively filtered, 93 features were computed from the stationary wavelet transform analysis, and random forests were used for classification. A repeated stratified nested cross-validation procedure was used for feature selection, parameter tuning, and model assessment. Data were partitioned patient-wise. The classifiers were evaluated using per class sensitivity, and the unweighted mean of sensitivities (UMS) as a global performance metric. Four levels of clinical detail were studied: shock/no-shock, shock/AS/ORG, VF/VT/AS/ORG, and VF/VT/AS/PEA/PR.

For shock/no-shock decisions sensitivities were 93.5% (93.0-93.9) and 97.2% (97.0-97.4), meeting clinical standards for artifact-free EKG. The UMS for five classes with CPR artifacts was 5.8-points below that of the best algorithms without CPR artifacts, but improved the UMS of latter by over 19-points for EKG with CPR artifacts.

Important audio parameters such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), log Mel-filterbank energy spectrum and Fourier Spectrum were used as feature set. Additionally, the dataset was augmented with more sample data by the use of audio augmentation techniques such as time and pitch shifting. Together with the feature extraction this data augmentation can achieve reasonable accuracy. Four events such as crash, tire skid, horn and siren sounds can be accurately identified giving indication of a road hazard that can be useful for traffic operators or paramedics.

The thoracic impedance signal acquired by monitor-defibrillators during treatment can be used to provide feedback on ventilations, but chest compression components prevent accurate detection of ventilations. This study introduces the first method for accurate ventilation detection using the impedance while chest compressions are concurrently delivered by a mechanical CPR device. A total of 423 OHCA patients treated with mechanical CPR were included, 761 analysis intervals were selected which in total comprised 5 884 minutes and contained 34 864 ventilations. Ground truth ventilations were determined using the expired CO (2) channel. The method uses adaptive signal processing to obtain the impedance ventilation waveform. Then, 14 features were calculated from the ventilation waveform and fed to a random forest (RF) classifier to discriminate false positive detections from actual ventilations. The RF feature importance was used to determine the best feature subset for the classifier. The method was trained and tested using stratified 10-fold cross validation (CV) partitions. The training/test process was repeated 20 times to statistically characterize the results. The best ventilation detector had a median (interdecile range, IDR) F (1)-score of 96.32 (96.26-96.37).

In this study we propose novel deep learning architectures for shock decision algorithms based on convolutional and residual networks. EKG electronic recordings from a cohort of 852 OHCA cases (4216 AED EKG analyses) were used in the study. EKGs were annotated by a pool of six expert clinicians resulting in 3718 nonshockable and 498 shockable EKGs.

A unique contribution lies in combining time domain features, including root mean square (RMS) and zero-crossing rate, to capture the temporal characteristics, like signal energy changes, with frequency domain features derived from short-time Fourier transform (STFT). These include spectral centroid, spectral bandwidth, and spectral roll-off, providing insights into the sound's frequency content for differentiating siren patterns from traffic noise. Additionally, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are incorporated to capture the human-like auditory perception of the spectral information. This combination captures both temporal and spectral characteristics of the audio signals, enhancing the model's ability to discriminate between emergency vehicles and traffic noise compared to using features from a single domain. A significant contribution of this study is the integration of data augmentation techniques that replicate real-world conditions, including the Doppler effect and noise environment considerations. This study further investigates the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms applied to the extracted features, performing a comparative analysis to determine the most effective classifier for this task.

Hence the need arises for simulating and optimizing traffic control algorithms to better accommodate this increasing demand. Fuzzy optimization deals with finding the values of input parameters of a complex simulated system which result in desired output. This paper presents a MATLAB simulation of fuzzy logic traffic controller for controlling flow of traffic in isolated intersections. This controller is based on the waiting time and queue length of vehicles at present green phase and vehicles queue lengths at the other phases. The controller controls the traffic light timings and phase difference to ascertain sebaceous flow of traffic with least waiting time and queue length. In this paper, the isolated intersection model used consists of two alleyways in each approach. Every outlook has different value of queue length and waiting time, systematically, at the intersection. The maximum value of waiting time and vehicle queue length has to be selected by using proximity sensors as inputs to controller for the ameliorate control traffic flow at the intersection. An intelligent traffic model and fuzzy logic traffic controller are developed to evaluate the performance of traffic controller under different pre-defined conditions for oleaginous flow of traffic.

The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of developing an AI-TOR rule for neurologically favorable outcomes using general purpose AI and compare its performance to the Universal TOR rule. METHODS: We identified OHCA cases of presumed cardiac etiology who were 18 years of age or older from 2016 to 2019 in the All-Japan Utstein Registry. We divided the dataset into 2 parts, the first half (2016-2017) was used as a training dataset for rule development and second half (2018-2019) for validation. The AI software (Prediction One(R)) created the model using the training dataset with internal cross-validation. It also evaluated the prediction accuracy and displayed the ranking of influencing variables. We performed validation using the second half cases and calculated the prediction model AUC. The top four of the 11 variables identified in the model were then selected as prognostic factors to be used in an AI-TOR rule, and sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated from validation cohort. This was then compared to the performance of the Universal TOR rule using same dataset. RESULTS: There were 504,561 OHCA cases, 18 years of age or older, 302,799 cases were presumed cardiac origin. Of these, 149,425 cases were used for the training dataset and 153,374 cases for the validation dataset. The model developed by AI using 11 variables had an AUC of 0.969, and its AUC for the validation dataset was 0.965. The top four influencing variables for neurologically favorable outcome were Prehospital ROSC, witnessed by EMS, Age (68 years old and younger) and nonasystole. The AUC calculated using the 4 variables for the AI-TOR rule was 0.953, and its AUC for the validation dataset was 0.952 (95%CI 0.949 -0.954). Of 80,198 patients in the validation cohort that satisfied all four criteria for the AI-TOR rule, 58 (0.07%) had a neurologically favorable one-month survival. The specificity of AI-TOR rule was 0.990, and the PPV was 0.999 for predicting lack of neurologically favorable survival, both the specificity and PPV were higher than that achieved with the universal TOR (0.959, 0.998). CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of prediction models using AI software to determine outcomes in OHCA was excellent and the AI-TOR rule's variables from prediction model performed better than the Universal TOR rule. External validation of our findings as well as further research into the utility of using AI platforms for TOR prediction in clinical practice is needed.",10.1016/j.resuscitation.2024.110165,Humans;Adolescent;Adult;Aged;*Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest/therapy;Resuscitation Orders;*Emergency Medical Services;Artificial Intelligence;*Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation;Hospitals;Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest;Termination of Resuscitation

There are many models and algorithms which help predict the future location with high probabilities. However, in terms of efficiency and accuracy, the existing algorithms are still improving. In this study, a novel algorithm, NextSTMove, is proposed according to the available dataset which results in lower latency and higher probability. Apache Spark, a big data platform, was used for reducing the processing time and efficiently managing computing resources. The algorithm achieved 75% to 85% accuracy and in some cases 100% accuracy, where the users do not change their daily routine frequently. After comparing the prediction results of our algorithm, it was experimentally found that it predicts processes up to 300% faster than traditional algorithms.

In this study, we developed and validated an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm based on deep learning to predict the need for critical care during EMS. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observation cohort study. The algorithm was established using development data from the Korean national emergency department information system, which were collected during visits in real time from 151 emergency departments (EDs). We validated the algorithm using EMS run sheets from two EDs. The study subjects comprised adult patients who visited EDs. The endpoint was critical care, and we used age, sex, chief complaint, symptom onset to arrival time, trauma, and initial vital signs as the predicted variables. RESULTS: The number of patients in the development data was 8,981,181, and the validation data comprised 2604 EMS run sheets from two hospitals.

Therefore, the location of these stations is an important issue in urban planning. Health center location-allocation is considered as an NP-hard problem. Due to the long computation time, exact methods will not be effective in solving these problems. On the contrary, many meta-heuristic algorithms have been introduced as promising solutions in various engineering applications. But, it is realized that adaptation of the exploration and exploitation for solving complex optimization problems are challenging tasks. To cope with these challenges, a novel three-dimensional migration model of biogeography-based optimization (TDMBBO) has been introduced to optimize the constrained linear p-median problem. In TDMBBO, nonlinear migration rates based on quadratic, cubic, sinusoidal, and hyperbolic tangent functions have been proposed. In most of the previous migration models, one function for the migration rate has been used. The main disadvantage of these models is that emigration and immigration rates follow a single mathematical function. In the proposed model, for the migration rates of each habitat, a special mathematical model is considered that can apply the appropriate migration rate. The behavior of TDMBBO has been examined on two allocation datasets, IEEE CEC benchmark problems, three random datasets, and two real-world optimization problems. To evaluate the performance of TDMBBO, 31 competitive and state-of-the-art meta-heuristics and five BBO algorithms with different migration models (previous studies) have been used. In allocation datasets, geographic information system has been used to select candidate sites. Parametric and nonparametric tests have also been used to evaluate the performance of algorithms. Overall, TDMBBO yields far better results in many aspects than the other algorithms. The TDMBBO results show a high potential for a location-allocation problems. In IEEE CEC problems, TDMBBO showed rapid convergence compared to other algorithms. The results show the TDMBBO's superiority and this algorithm's capability in solving real-world optimization problems. In the end, some open problems related to TDMBBO are highlighted encouraging future research in this area.",10.1007/s11227-023-05047-z,location-allocation;p-median problem;geographic information system;improved biogeography-based optimization;and meta-heuristic;location-allocation;algorithm;network

To improve OHCA success rates, this study assessed the prognostic interactions resulting from simultaneously modifying two prehospital factors using a trained machine learning model. METHODS: We enrolled 8274 OHCA patients resuscitated by emergency medical services (EMS) in Nara prefecture, Japan, with a unified activity protocol between January 2010 and December 2018; patients younger than 18 and those with noncardiogenic cardiopulmonary arrest were excluded. Next, a three-layer neural network model was constructed to predict the cerebral performance category score of 1 or 2 at one month based on 24 features of prehospital EMS activity. Using this model, we evaluated the prognostic impact of continuously and simultaneously varying the transport time and the defibrillation or drug-administration time in the test data based on heatmaps. RESULTS: The average class sensitivity of the prognostic model was more than 0.86, with a full area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.94 (95% confidence interval of 0.92-0.96). By adjusting the two time factors simultaneously, a nonlinear interaction was obtained between the two adjustments, instead of a linear prediction of the outcome. CONCLUSION: Modifications to the parameters using a machine-learning-based prognostic model indicated an interaction among the prognostic factors.

Increasing extreme temperature events will place more pressure on public health and emergency medical resources, and societies will need to find effective and reliable solutions to adapt to hotter summers. This study developed an effective method to predict the number of daily heat-related ambulance calls. Both national- and regional-level models were developed to evaluate the performance of machine-learning-based methods on heat-related ambulance call prediction. The national model showed a high prediction accuracy and can be applied over most regions, while the regional model showed extremely high prediction accuracy in each corresponding region and reliable accuracy in special cases. We found that the introduction of heatwave features, including accumulated heat stress, heat acclimatization, and optimal temperature, significantly improved prediction accuracy. The adjusted coefficient of determination (adjusted R(2)) of the national model improved from 0.9061 to 0.9659 by including these features, and the adjusted R(2) of the regional model also improved from 0.9102 to 0.9860.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a time-adaptive conditional prediction model (TACOM) to predict clinical outcomes every minute. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study using data from the Korea OHCA Registry in South Korea. In this study, we excluded patients with trauma, those who experienced return of spontaneous circulation before arriving in the emergency department (ED), and those who did not receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the ED. We selected patients who received CPR in the ED. To develop the time-adaptive prediction model, we organized the training data set as ongoing CPR patients by the minute. A total of 49,669 patients were divided into 39,602 subjects for training and 10,067 subjects for validation. We compared random forest, LightGBM, and artificial neural networks as the prediction model methods. Model performance was quantified using the prediction probability of the model, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and area under the precision recall curve. RESULTS: Among the three algorithms, LightGBM showed the best performance.

We tested the hypothesis that addition of a real-time decision-assist machine-learning algorithm, the compensatory reserve measurement (CRM), used by combat medics could shorten the time required to identify the need for intervention in an unstable patient during a hemorrhage profile as compared with vital signs alone. METHODS: We randomized combat medics from the Army Medical Department Center and School Health Readiness Center of Excellence into three groups: group 1 viewed a display of no simulated hemorrhage and unchanging vital signs as a control (n = 24), group 2 viewed a display of simulated hemorrhage and changing vital signs alone (hemorrhage; n = 31), and group 3 viewed a display of changing vital signs with the addition of the CRM (hemorrhage + CRM; n = 22). Participants were asked to push a computer key when they believed the patient was becoming unstable and needed medical intervention. RESULTS: The average time of 11.0 minutes (95% confidence interval, 8.7-13.3 minutes) required by the hemorrhage + CRM group to identify an unstable patient (i.e., stop the video sequence) was less by more than 40% (p < 0.01) compared with 18.9 minutes (95% confidence interval, 17.2-20.5 minutes) in the hemorrhage group. CONCLUSION: The use of a machine-learning monitoring technology designed to measure the capacity to compensate for central blood volume loss resulted in reduced time required by combat medics to identify impending hemodynamic instability.

We retrospectively used 13,570 CPR episodes from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) interventions reviewed in a period of interest from 30 s before to 10 s after regular analysis of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). Three convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with raw ECG input (duration of 5, 10, and 15 s) were applied for the shock advisory decision during CPR in 26 sequential analyses shifted by 1 s. The start and stop of chest compressions (CC) can occur at arbitrary times in sequential slides; therefore, the sliding hands-off time (sHOT) quantifies the cumulative CC-free portion of the analyzed ECG. An independent test with CPR episodes in 393 ventricular fibrillations (VF), 177 normal sinus rhythms (NSR), 1848 other non-shockable rhythms (ONR), and 3979 asystoles (ASYS) showed a substantial improvement of VF sensitivity when increasing the analysis duration from 5 s to 10 s. Specificity was not dependent on the ECG analysis duration. The 10 s CNN model presented the best performance: 92-94.4% (VF), 92.2-94% (ASYS), 96-97% (ONR), and 98.2-99.5% (NSR) for sliding decision times during CPR; 98-99% (VF), 98.2-99.8% (ASYS), 98.8-99.1 (ONR), and 100% (NSR) for sliding decision times after end of CPR. We identified the importance of sHOT as a reliable predictor of performance, accounting for the minimal sHOT interval of 2-3 s that provides a reliable rhythm detection satisfying the American Heart Association (AHA) standards for AED rhythm analysis. The presented technology for sliding shock advisory decision during CPR achieved substantial performance improvement in short hands-off periods (>2 s), such as insufflations or pre-shock pauses. The performance was competitive despite 1-2.8% point lower ASYS detection during CPR than the standard requirement (95%) for non-noisy ECG signals. The presented deep learning strategy is a basis for improved CPR practices involving both continuous CC and CC with insufflations, associated with minimal CC interruptions for reconfirmation of non-shockable rhythms (minimum hands-off time) and early treatment of VF (minimal pre-shock pauses).",10.3390/s23094500,"Humans;*Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation;Retrospective Studies;*Deep Learning;Electrocardiography;Ventricular Fibrillation;Arrhythmias, Cardiac/diagnosis;*Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest/therapy/complications;Algorithms;Cnn;Cpr;Ecg;Vf;arrhythmia;continuous ECG analysis;deep neural networks;out-of-hospital cardiac arrest;shockable rhythm"

So far, limited research and optimization of DNNs in shock advisory systems is found on large ECG arrhythmia databases from out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA). The objective of this study is to optimize the hyperparameters (HPs) of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for detection of shockable (Sh) and nonshockable (NSh) rhythms, and to validate the best HP settings for short and long analysis durations (2-10 s). Large numbers of (Sh + NSh) ECG samples were used for training (720 + 3170) and validation (739 + 5921) from Holters and defibrillators in OHCA. An end-to-end deep CNN architecture was implemented with one-lead raw ECG input layer (5 s, 125 Hz, 2.5 uV/LSB), configurable number of 5 to 23 hidden layers and output layer with diagnostic probability p in [0: Sh,1: NSh]. The hidden layers contain N convolutional blocks x 3 layers (Conv1D (filters = Fi, kernel size = Ki), max-pooling (pool size = 2), dropout (rate = 0.3)), one global max-pooling and one dense layer. Random search optimization of HPs = N, Fi, Ki, i = 1, ... N in a large grid of N = [1, 2, ... 7], Fi = [5;50], Ki = [5;100] was performed. During training, the model with maximal balanced accuracy BAC = (Sensitivity + Specificity)/2 over 400 epochs was stored. The optimization principle is based on finding the common HPs space of a few top-ranked models and prediction of a robust HP setting by their median value. The optimal models for 1-7 CNN layers were trained with different learning rates LR = [10(-5); 10(-2)] and the best model was finally validated on 2-10 s analysis durations. A number of 4216 random search models were trained. The optimal models with more than three convolutional layers did not exhibit substantial differences in performance BAC = (99.31-99.5%).

Signal Quality Assessment (SQA) systems can prevent false diagnoses by automated arrhythmia detection systems and reduce the workload of cardiologists. However, current SQA methods are quite complex and/or exhibit poor performances in presence of certain arrhythmias. This study proposed a novel SQA method consisting of three main steps: (1) feasibility conditions check, (2) average beat correlation algorithm, and (3) beat clustering algorithm. The system uses empirical probability functions to automatically adapt the quality score according to the presence of pathological beats and/or noises. We evaluated the proposed method on three datasets and considered both three-quality classes ('Bad', 'HR' and 'Diagnostic') and two-quality classes ('Acceptable' and 'Unacceptable'). For the three-class classification, we obtained an average accuracy of 81.42 % while for the two-class, our algorithm achieved an average sensitivity of 94.59 %, a specificity of 98.38 %, and an accuracy of 97.10 %. The results show that our method achieves high accuracy, specificity and generalizability, outperforming the simple heuristic rule, machine learning, and deep learning methods.

This study aimed to develop and validate a deep-learning-based out-of-hospital cardiac arrest prognostic system (DCAPS) for predicting neurologic recovery and survival to discharge. METHODS: The study subjects were patients from the Korea OHCA registry who experienced return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after OHCA. A total of 36,190 patients were exclusively divided into a set of 28,045 subjects for derivation data and 8,145 subjects for validation data. We used information available for the time of ROSC as predictor variables, and the endpoints were neurologic recovery (cerebral performance category 1 or 2) and survival to discharge. The DCAPS was developed using the derivation data and represented the favorability of prognosis with a score between 0 and 100. RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of DCAPS for predicting neurologic recovery for the validation data was 0.953 [95% confidence interval 0.952-0.954]; these results significantly outperformed those of logistic regression (0.947 [0.943-0.948]), random forest (0.943 [0.942-0.945]), support vector machine (0.930 [0.929-0.932]), and conventional methods of a previous study (0.817 [0.815-0.820]). The AUROC of the DCAPS for survival to discharge was 0.901 [0.900-0.903], and this result significantly outperformed those of other models as well.

However, it is not uncommon for real-world EMS systems to experience batch arrivals of EMS requests, where a single call involves more than one patient. Properly capturing such batch arrivals is needed to enhance the quality of analyses, thereby improving the fidelity of a resulting system design. This paper proposes a spatio-temporal demand model that incorporates batch arrivals of EMS calls. Specifically, we construct a spatio-temporal compound Poisson process which consists of a call arrival model and call size model. We build our call arrival model by combining two models available in the existing EMS demand modeling literature-artificial neural network and spatio-temporal Gaussian mixture model. For the call size model, we develop a k-inflated mixture regression model. This model reflects the characteristics of EMS call arrivals that most calls involve one patient while some calls involve multiple patients. The utility of the proposed EMS demand model is illustrated by a probabilistic ambulance location model, where we show ignoring batch arrivals leads to overestimation of ambulance availability.",10.1007/s10696-020-09402-7,demand modeling;batch arrival;spatio-temporal variability;emergency medical service system;mixture model;ambulance location;relocation;ems;convolution;vehicles

Despite recent ""fast"" initiatives that have underscored ""time is brain,"" many patients still fail to present within the narrow time window to receive maximum treatment benefit from advanced stroke therapies. The convergence of emergency medical services, telemedicine, and mobile technology, including transportable computed tomography scanners, has presented a unique opportunity to advance patient stroke care in the prehospital field by shortening the time to hyperacute stroke treatment with a mobile stroke unit. However, in order to facilitate the integration of computed tomography (CT) scanners into small ambulances, their geometry should be streamlined and made compact. Additionally, it is imperative that radiation exposure from prehospital CT scans comply with established radiation protection guidelines to safeguard both patients and healthcare workers. In this study, we propose a newly designed CT system for a rotation-free rectangular gantry with a photon-counting detector (PCD) and a deep-learning reconstruction approach for undersampled projections. Undersampled projections obtained using the designed CT system were implemented using a deep learning method. The deep learning approach showed superior image quality without distortion compared to state-of-the-art reconstruction methods. Finally, we implemented imaging of brain microhemorrhages using lowand high-energy images obtained from the PCD. Our results indicate that the proposed scanner effectively shows potential for acute stroke detection in prehospital ambulances.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients suspected of having STEMI by emergency medical technicians (EMTs) were identified from a policy research dataset. A deep learning-based ECG analyzer (QCG analyzer) extracted a STEMI biomarker (qSTEMI) from prehospital ECGs. The biomarker was compared to a group of human experts, including five emergency medical service directors (board-certified emergency physicians) and three interventional cardiologists based on their consensus score (number of participants answering ""yes"" for STEMI). Non-inferiority of the biomarker was tested using a 0.100 margin of difference in sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: Among 53 analyzed patients (24 STEMI, 45.3%), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of qSTEMI and consensus score were 0.815 (0.691-0.938) and 0.736 (0.594-0.879), respectively (p=0.081).

The problem is modeled as a multitrip pickup and delivery problem with time windows and manpower planning (MTPDPTW-MP) that not only needs to design and schedule ambulance routes satisfying a series of constraints but also requires staff scheduling. Because of the strict limits on route duration, each ambulance traverses several routes per day, which, starting and terminating at the depot, complete a series of pickup and delivery operations to serve the clients. A feasible route demands a driver and several assistants to serve the clients and needs to satisfy some constraints, such as capacity, pickup before delivery, time windows, etc. The objective is hierarchical in that it primarily serves as many clients as possible, then minimizes the operational cost, and finally strikes a balance for the staff workload. Theoretically, MTPDPTW-MP, which is a combination of two well known NP-hard problems (i.e., the pickup and delivery problem with time windows and the staff scheduling problem), is difficult to solve. In this study, we propose an iterated local search metaheuristic that uses a variable neighborhood descent procedure in the local search phase. We use a modified regret insertion method to construct solutions; a heuristic backtracking algorithm is designed to schedule staff. To speed up the process, we adapt the segment-based evaluation for moves and reduce the neighborhoods explored based on the characteristics of the problem. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was tested in real-world instances. Results showed that it can serve more requests than the manually designed plans.

This paper proposes a distributionally robust model for optimizing the location, number of ambulances and demand assignment in an EMS system by minimizing the expected total cost. The model guarantees that the probability of satisfying the maximum concurrent demand in the whole system is larger than a predetermined reliability level by introducing joint chance constraints and characterizes the expected total cost by moment uncertainty based on a data-driven approach. The model is approximated as a parametric second-order conic representable program. Furthermore, a special case of the model is considered and converted into a standard second-order cone program, which can be efficiently solved with a proposed outer approximation algorithm. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the benefit of the proposed approach. Moreover, a dataset from a real application is also used to demonstrate the application of the data-driven approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Several ROSC prediction scores have been developed with European cohorts, with unclear applicability in Asian settings. We aimed to develop an interpretable prehospital ROSC (P-ROSC) score for ROSC prediction based on patients with OHCA in Asia. METHODS: This retrospective study examined patients who suffered from OHCA between Jan 1, 2009 and Jun 17, 2018 using data recorded in the Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcomes Study (PAROS) registry. AutoScore, an interpretable machine learning framework, was used to develop P-ROSC. On the same cohort, the P-ROSC was compared with two clinical scores, the RACA and the UB-ROSC. The predictive power was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) in the receiver operating characteristic analysis. FINDINGS: 170,678 cases were included, of which 14,104 (8.26%) attained prehospital ROSC. The P-ROSC score identified a new variable, prehospital drug administration, which was not included in the RACA score or the UB-ROSC score. Using only five variables, the P-ROSC score achieved an AUC of 0.806 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.799-0.814), outperforming both RACA and UB-ROSC with AUCs of 0.773 (95% CI 0.765-0.782) and 0.728 (95% CI 0.718-0.738), respectively.

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to develop and validate practical machine learning (ML)-based models to predict early outcomes of nontraumatic OHCA for use in the emergency department (ED). We compared their discrimination and calibration performances with the traditional logistic regression (LR) approach. METHODS: Between October 1, 2017 and March 31, 2020, prehospital resuscitation was performed on 17,166 OHCA patients. There were 8157 patients 18 years or older with nontraumatic OHCA who received continued resuscitation in the ED included for analysis. Eleven demographic and resuscitation predictor variables were extracted to predict survived events, defined as any sustained return of spontaneous circulation until in-hospital transfer of care. Prediction models based on random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and LR were created with hyperparameter optimization. Model performances on internal and external validation were compared using discrimination and calibration statistics. RESULTS: The three models showed similar discrimination performances with c-statistics values of 0.712 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.711-0.713) for LR, 0.714 (95% CI 0.712-0.717) for RF, and 0.712 (95% CI 0.710-0.713) for MLP models on external validation. For calibration, MLP model had a better performance (slope of calibration regression line = 1.10, intercept = -0.09) than LR (slope = 1.17, intercept = -0.11) and RF (slope = 1.16, intercept= -0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Two practical ML-based and one regression-based clinical prediction models of nontraumatic OHCA for survived events were developed and validated.

METHODS: A registry-based, retrospective analysis was conducted of adult trauma patients who were treated by physician-staffed emergency medical services in southwestern Germany between 2018 and 2020. The primary outcome was to assess the feasibility of using the random forest (RF) and Naive Bayes (NB) machine learning algorithms to predict the need for preclinical airway management. The secondary outcome was to use a principal component analysis to determine the attributes that can be used and advanced for future model development. RESULTS: In total, 25,556 adults with multiple injuries were identified, including 1,451 patients (5.7%) who required airway management. Key attributes were auscultation, injury pattern, oxygen therapy, thoracic drainage, noninvasive ventilation, catecholamines, pelvic sling, colloid infusion, initial vital signs, preemergency status, and shock index. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was between 0.96 (RF; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96-0.97) and 0.93 (NB; 95% CI, 0.92-0.93; P<0.01).

The design of an efficient ambulance location model is pivotal in enhancing survival rates, controlling morbidity, and preventing disability. Key factors in the classical models typically include travel time, demand zones, and the number of stations. While urban EMS systems have received extensive examination due to their centralized populations, rural areas pose distinct challenges. These include lower population density and longer response distances, contributing to a higher fatality rate due to sparse population distribution, limited EMS stations, and extended travel times. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel mathematical model that aims to optimize coverage and equity. A distinctive feature of our model is the integration of equity within the objective function, coupled with a focus on practical response time that includes the period required for personal protective equipment procedures, ensuring the model's applicability and realism in emergency response scenarios. We tackle the proposed problem using a tailored genetic algorithm and propose a greedy algorithm for solution construction. The implementation of our tailored Genetic Algorithm promises efficient and effective EMS solutions, potentially enhancing emergency care and health outcomes in rural communities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Leanne""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: mop,A.

METHOD: The system uses the geolocations of public accessible defibrillators and ambulance services along with the times when people are likely to have a cardiac arrest to calculate response times. For comparison, a Genetic Algorithm has been developed to determine the strategic number and positions of drone bases to optimize OHCA emergency response times.

Bulawayo City Councils' ambulance services department was used as a case study. Two models, feed-forward neural network (FFNN) and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average, (SARIMA) were developed using monthly historical data from 2010 to 2017 and compared against observed data for 2018. The mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and paired sample t-test were used as performance measures. Calculated performance measures for FFNN were MAE (94.0), RMSE (137.19), and the test statistic value p=0.493(>0.05) whilst corresponding values for SARIMA were 105.71, 125.28, and p=0.005(<0.05), respectively. Findings of this study suggest that the FFNN model is inclined to value estimation whilst the SARIMA model is directional with a linear pattern over time. Based on the performance measures, the parsimonious FFNN model was selected to predict short-term annual ambulance demand. Demand forecasts with FFNN for 2019 reflected the expected general trends in Bulawayo. The forecasts indicate high demand during the months of January, March, September, and December. Key ambulance logistic activities such as vehicle servicing, replenishment of essential equipment and drugs, staff training, leave days scheduling, and mock drills need to be planned for April, June, and July when low demand is anticipated.

Given that the demand for ambulances is known to fluctuate spatially and temporally based on the time of day and day of the week, EMS practitioners depend on call volume forecasts to develop staffing and dynamic redeployment plans. In this study, a series of daily, hourly, and spatially distributed hourly call volume predictions are generated using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network model following feature selection using an ensemble-based decision tree model. For spatially distributed predictions, K-Means clustering is applied to produce heterogeneous spatial clusters based on call location and associated call volume densities. The predictive performance of the MLP model is benchmarked against both a selection of traditional time-series forecasting techniques and a common industry method. Results show that MLP models outperform time-series and industry forecasting methods, specifically at finer levels of spatial granularity where the need for more accurate call volumes forecasts is more essential.

Waiting for the green light is a major cause of traffic congestion. Low throughput rates and eventual congestion come from many traffic signals that are hard coded, irrespective of the volume of the amount of traffic. Instead of depending on predefined time intervals, it is essential to build a traffic signal control system that can react to changing vehicle densities. Emergency vehicles, like ambulances, must be given priority at the intersection so as not to spend more time at the traffic light. Computer vision techniques can be used to improve road traffic signal control and reduce real-time traffic delays at intersections without the requirement for substantial infrastructure analysis. Long wait times and significant energy consumption are just two of the problems of the current traffic signal control system. To optimal efficiency, the traffic signal's duration must be dynamically changed to account for current traffic volume. To lessen congestion, the approach taken in this research focuses on modifying traffic signal time determined by the density of vehicles at the crossroads. The main purpose of this article is to demonstrate heavy traffic and emergency vehicle prioritization from all directions at the traffic intersection for a speedy passage. Using the Pygame tool, the proposed method in this study, which includes a mechanism for estimating traffic density and prioritization by counting vehicles at a traffic junction, is demonstrated. The vehicle throughput for the adaptive traffic light built using Pygame is compared with the vehicle pass rate for the adaptive traffic light built using Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO). The simulation results show that the adaptive traffic light built using Pygame achieves 90% throughput compared to the adaptive traffic light built using SUMO. A Two-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (2D-CNN) is implemented using Tensorflow for vehicle classification. The 2D-CNN model demonstrated 96% accuracy in classifying vehicles using the test dataset.

Outcomes included final diagnosis of stroke versus nonstroke, large vessel occlusion, severe stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score >5), and comprehensive stroke center-eligible stroke (large vessel occlusion or hemorrhagic stroke). RESULTS: Of 965 patients, 580 (60%) had confirmed acute stroke. In a test set of 289 patients, the text-based model predicted stroke nominally better than models based on the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (c-statistic: 0.73 versus 0.67, P=0.165) and was superior to the 3-Item Stroke Scale (c-statistic: 0.73 versus 0.53, P<0.001) scores. Improvements in discrimination were also observed for the other outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: We derived a model that utilizes clinical text from paramedic reports to identify stroke.

This paper presents the optimization of EMS vehicle fleet allocation and base station location through the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) with an integrated EMS simulation model. Two tiers to the EMS model realized the different demands on two vehicle classes; ambulances and rapid response cars. Multiple patient classes were modelled and survival functions used to differentiate the required levels of service. The objective was maximization of the overall expected survival probability across patient classes. Applications of the model were undertaken using real call data from the London Ambulance Service. The simulation model was shown to effectively emulate real-life performance. Optimization of the existing resource plan resulted in significant improvements in survival probability. Optimizing a selection of 1 hour periods in the plan, without introducing additional resources, resulted in a notable increase in the number of cardiac arrest patients surviving per year. The introduction of an additional base station further improved survival when its location and resourcing were optimized for key periods of service. Also, the removal of a base station from the system was found to have minimal impact on survival probability when the selected station and resourcing were optimized simultaneously.

An accurate forecast of EMS calls is involved in ambulance fleet dispatching and routing to minimize response times to emergency calls and enhance the efficacy of assistance. Yet, the demand for emergency services exhibits significant variability, posing a challenge in accurately predicting the future occurrence of emergency calls and their spatial-temporal distribution. Here, we propose a stacking ensemble machine learning model to forecast EMS calls, combining different base learners to enhance the overall performance of generalization. Additionally, we conducted experiments using Boruta, Lasso, RFFI and SHAP feature selection methods to identify the most informative attributes from the EMS dataset. The proposed ensemble model integrates a base layer and a meta layer. In the base layer, we applied four base learners: Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting Regression Tree, Light Gradient Boosting Machine and Random Forest. In the meta layer, we used an optimized Random Forest model to integrate the outputs of base learners. We evaluate the performance of our proposed model using the R2 -score and four different error metrics. Based on a real data set including spatial, temporal and weather features, the findings of this study demonstrated that the proposed stacking-based ensemble model showed a better score and the minimum errors compared to the traditional single algorithms, online machine learning methods and voting ensemble methods. We achieved a higher score of 0.9954, mse of 0.8938, rmse of 0.9454, mae of 0.2923 and mape of 0.0724 compared to state-of-the-art models.

The modern case-mix of prehospital patients is broad and complex, diverging from the traditional 'time critical accident and emergency' patients. It now includes many low-acuity patients and those with social care and mental health needs. In the ambulance service, transport decisions are the hardest to make and paramedics decide to take more patients to the ED than would have a clinical benefit. As such, this study asked the following research questions: In adult patients attending the ED by ambulance, can prehospital information predict an avoidable attendance? What is the simulated transportability of the model derived from the primary outcome? A linked dataset of 101,522 ambulance service and ED ambulance incidents linked to their respective ED care record from the whole of Yorkshire between 1st July 2019 and 29th February 2020 was used as the sample for this study. A machine learning method known as XGBoost was applied to the data in a novel way called Internal-External Cross Validation (IECV) to build the model. The results showed great discrimination with a C-statistic of 0.81 (95%CI 0.79-0.83) and excellent calibration with an O:E ratio was 0.995 (95% CI 0.97-1.03), with the most important variables being a patient's mobility, their physiological observations and clinical impression with psychiatric problems, allergic reactions, cardiac chest pain, head injury, non-traumatic back pain, and minor cuts and bruising being the most important. This study has successfully developed a decision-support model that can be transformed into a tool that could help paramedics make better transport decisions on scene, known as the SINEPOST model. It is accurate, and spatially validated across multiple geographies including rural, urban, and coastal. It is a fair algorithm that does not discriminate new patients based on their age, gender, ethnicity, or decile of deprivation. It can be embedded into an electronic Patient Care Record system and automatically calculate the probability that a patient will have an avoidable attendance at the ED, if they were transported.

Both of the mare expected to impact human health. Climate can increase health risks from poor air quality and lead to emergencies. Forecasting health consequences of air pollution episodes is a matter of great concern.     Objectives: The current study mainly aimed at simulating the climate change impact on emergency medical services (EMS) clients caused by air pollution to estimate the future trend of EMS clients with cardiovascular and respiratory symptoms by 2050.     Methods: Future climate pattern was projected using general circulation model outputs under the scenario of two representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). Statistical downscaling was performed by LARS weather generator to produce high-resolution synthetic time series weather dataset. Simulation was performed using an artificial neural network (ANN). Observed climate and air pollutant variables were tagged as predictors in ANN, and EMS clients were considered as the target. Projected future (2020 - 2050) climate and air pollution were applied to estimate the future trend of EMS clients.     Results: The climate pattern was predicted to become warmer and wetter in the study area (Tehran, Iran). Annual trend of EMS clients with cardiovascular and respiratory symptoms increases under both RCP scenarios. Further increase is under RCP8.5 for EMS clients with cardiovascular symptoms, and the least increase is under RCP2.6 for those with respiratory symptoms. Annual and monthly trends of EMS clients with cardiovascular and respiratory problems are more sensitive to different groups of climate and air pollution variables.

We sought to perform the first large artificial intelligence- (AI-) guided statistical and geographic information system (GIS) analysis of a multiyear and multisite cohort for OHCA outcomes (incidence and poor neurological disposition). METHOD: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of a prospectively collected multicenter dataset of adult patients who sequentially presented to Houston metro area hospitals from 01/01/07-01/01/16. Then AI-based machine learning (backward propagation neural network) augmented multivariable regression and GIS heat mapping were performed. RESULTS: Of 3,952 OHCA patients across 38 hospitals, African Americans were the most likely to suffer OHCA despite representing a significantly lower percentage of the population (42.6 versus 22.8%; p < 0.001). Compared to Caucasians, they were significantly more likely to have poor neurological disposition (OR 2.21, 95%CI 1.25-3.92; p=0.006) and be discharged to a facility instead of home (OR 1.39, 95%CI 1.05-1.85; p=0.023). Compared to the safety net hospital system primarily serving poorer African Americans, the university hospital serving primarily higher income commercially and Medicare insured patients had the lowest odds of death (OR 0.45, p < 0.001). Each additional $10,000 above median household income was associated with a decrease in the total number of cardiac arrests per zip code by 2.86 (95%CI -4.26- -1.46; p < 0.001); zip codes with a median income above $54,600 versus the federal poverty level had 14.62 fewer arrests (p < 0.001). GIS maps showed convergence of the greater density of poor neurologic outcome cases and greater density of poorer African American residences.

This study conducts a cluster analysis of the correlation between location-related factors and the outcome of patients with OHCA using two machine learning methods: variational autoencoder (VAE) and the Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM). METHODS: Using the prospectively collected Smart Advanced Life Support registry in South Korea between August 2015 and December 2018, a secondary retrospective data analysis was performed on patients with OHCA with a presumed cause of cardiac arrest in adults of 18 years or older. VAE and DPMM were used to create clusters to determine groups with a common nature among those with OHCA. RESULTS: Among 5876 OHCA cases, 1510 patients were enrolled in the final analysis. Decision tree-based models, which have an accuracy of 95.36%, were also used to interpret the characteristics of clusters. A total of 8 clusters that had similar spatial characteristics were identified using DPMM and VAE. Among the generated clusters, the averages of the four clusters that exhibited a high survival to discharge rate and a favorable neurological outcome were 9.6% and 6.1%, and the averages of the four clusters that exhibited a low outcome were 5.1% and 3.5% respectively. In the decision tree-based models, the most important feature that could affect the prognosis of an OHCA patient was being transferred to a higher-level emergency center.

This study considers a mixed-integer programming model that determines the ambulance locations by considering the time of day variations in demand. The presented model also considers heterogeneous performance measures based on survival function and coverage for different patient types with varying levels of urgency. A memetic algorithm based-approach that applies a mixed chromosome representation for solutions is proposed to solve the problem. Our computational results indicate that neglecting time-dependent variation of demand can underestimate the number of ambulances required by up to 15% during peak demand.

Busy ambulances are common, but little is known about their effect on response times. OBJECTIVE: To assess the extent of busy ambulances in Central Norway and their impact on ambulance response times. DESIGN: This was a retrospective observational study. We used machine learning on data from nearby incidents to assess the probability of up to five different ambulances being candidates to respond to a medical emergency incident. For each incident, the probability of a busy ambulance was estimated by summing the probabilities of candidate ambulances being busy at the time of the incident. The difference in response time that may be attributable to busy ambulances was estimated by comparing groups of nearby incidents with different estimated busy probabilities. SETTING: Medical emergency incidents with ambulance response in Central Norway from 2013 to 2022. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of busy ambulances and differences in response times associated with busy ambulances. RESULTS: The estimated probability of busy ambulances for all 216,787 acute incidents with ambulance response was 26.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 26.6 to 26.9). Comparing nearby incidents, each 10-percentage point increase in the probability of a busy ambulance was associated with a delay of 0.60 minutes (95% CI 0.58 to 0.62). For incidents in rural and urban areas, the probability of a busy ambulance was 21.6% (95% CI 21.5 to 21.8) and 35.0% (95% CI 34.8 to 35.2), respectively. The delay associated with a 10-percentage point increase in busy probability was 0.81 minutes (95% CI 0.78 to 0.84) and 0.30 minutes (95% CI 0.28 to 0.32), respectively. CONCLUSION: Ambulances were often busy, which was associated with delayed ambulance response times. In rural areas, the probability of busy ambulances was lower, although the potentially longer delays when ambulances were busy made these areas more vulnerable.","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: mop,F.

While the primary objective is to save human Life, finding optimistic routes for Ambulances to transfer the patient to the nearest hospital by travelling in traffic congested routes during peak and non-peak hours with quick response time and minimized total cycle time remains a major challenge.While several techniques, Mathematical models and algorithms are used to arrive at a solution, data mining and machine learning techniques provides efficient methods in achieving the optimal results for the Ambulance Routing Problem. In this paper, Multilevel framework is developed for predicting the Optimized Ambulance routes using Random Forest Classification Trees. First, by using Advanced A* Algorithm the routes are determined for the Ambulances during peak and non-peak hours of traffic. The routes are calculated using the minimum dispersion index as a heuristics along with other constraints such as speed of the Vehicle, distance, number of vehicles crossing each junctions to assess the traffic conditions. Random Forest Classifier is used on the spatiotemporal data sets such as time of starting of Ambulance and the alternate route taken to predict the optimized routes which helps in further improving the response time and total cycle time. The criticial spatiotemporal features required to predict the Optimized Ambulance Routes are very well brought out by using Random Forest Trees.The experimental results reveals that the predicted routes improves the response time by 30 % and total cycle time by 40 %. ¬© 2022, Ismail Saritas.

A system is proposed to utilize connected vehicle technology for facilitating the movement of multiple ERVs in a two-way roadway. A biobjective model was developed to minimize the ERVs' travel/response times while maximizing safety. The proposed system can help non-ERVs stop in assigned locations and wait for the ERVs to pass. According to mission priority, different types of ERVs (ambulance, fire truck, and police car) can use a travel lane from the opposite direction (contraflow) to move faster. A hybrid nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II-particle swarm optimization (NSGAII-PSO) approach was used to solve the model faster than CPLEX. To evaluate the system's performance, different experiments, including various road types, numbers and types of ERVs, direction priorities, and congestion levels, have been conducted. Results demonstrate that the proposed system can improve the travel time of ERVs that have the priority to use the contraflow lane in cases where the other side of the roadway is less congested and has a shoulder (when opposing ERVs use a two-way roadway simultaneously). The proposed system can eliminate weaving and passing among non-ERVs in all cases compared to two current strategies (going to the right edge and vacating the ERV lane without receiving instructions).",10.1061/jtepbs.Teeng-7973,

However, to prevent CPR artifacts being superimposed on ECG morphology data, currently available automated external defibrillators (AEDs) require pauses in CPR for accurate analysis heart rhythms. In this study, we propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network-based Encoder-Decoder (CNNED) structure with a shock advisory algorithm to improve the accuracy and reliability of shock versus non-shock decision-making without CPR pause in OHCA scenarios. Our approach employs a cascade of CNNEDs in conjunction with an AED shock advisory algorithm to process the ECG data for shock decisions. Initially, a CNNED trained on an equal number of shockable and non-shockable rhythms is used to filter the CPR-contaminated data. The resulting filtered signal is then fed into a second CNNED, which is trained on imbalanced data more tilted toward the specific rhythm being analyzed. A reliable shock versus non-shock decision is made when both classifiers from the cascade structure agree, while segments with conflicting classifications are labeled as indeterminate, indicating the need for additional segments to analyze. To evaluate our approach, we generated CPR-contaminated ECG data by combining clean ECG data with 52 CPR samples. We used clean ECG data from the CUDB, AFDB, SDDB, and VFDB databases, to which 52 CPR artifact cases were added, while a separate test set provided by the AED manufacturer Defibtech LLC was used for performance evaluation. The test set comprised 20,384 non-shockable CPR-contaminated segments from 392 subjects, as well as 3744 shockable CPR-contaminated samples from 41 subjects with coarse ventricular fibrillation (VF) and 31 subjects with rapid ventricular tachycardia (rapid VT). We observed improvements in rhythm analysis using our proposed cascading CNNED structure when compared to using a single CNNED structure. Specifically, the specificity of the proposed cascade of CNNED structure increased from 99.14% to 99.35% for normal sinus rhythm and from 96.45% to 97.22% for other non-shockable rhythms. Moreover, the sensitivity for shockable rhythm detection increased from 90.90% to 95.41% for ventricular fibrillation and from 82.26% to 87.66% for rapid ventricular tachycardia. These results meet the performance thresholds set by the American Heart Association and demonstrate the reliable and accurate analysis of heart rhythms during CPR using only ECG data without the need for CPR interruptions or a reference signal.",10.1016/j.compbiomed.2024.108180,"Humans;Ventricular Fibrillation;Reproducibility of Results;Electrocardiography/methods;Defibrillators;Arrhythmias, Cardiac/diagnosis;*Tachycardia, Ventricular;Algorithms;*Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation/methods;Cardiopulmonary resuscitation;Convolutional Neural Network;Defibrillatory shock;Electrocardiogram;Encoder and decoder;Sudden cardiac arrest;Ventricular tachycardia"

We aimed to investigate emergency call characteristics where the machine-learning model failed to recognize OHCA or misinterpreted a call as being OHCA. METHODS: All emergency calls were linked to the dispatch database and verified OHCAs were identified by linkage to the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry. Calls with either false negative or false positive predictions of OHCA were evaluated by trained auditors. Descriptive analyses were performed with absolute numbers and percentages reported. RESULTS: The machine-learning model processed 169,236 calls to Copenhagen EMS and suspected 5,811 (3.4%) of the calls as OHCA, resulting in 84.5% sensitivity and 97.1% specificity. Among OHCAs not recognised by machine-learning model, a condition completely different from OHCA was presented by caller in 31% of the cases. In 28% of unrecognised calls, patient was reported breathing normally, and language barriers were identified in 23% of the cases. Among falsely suspected OHCA, the patient was reported unconscious in 28% of the cases, and in 13% of the false positive cases the machine-learning model interpreted calls regarding dead patients with irreversible signs of death as OHCA. CONCLUSION: Continuous optimization of the language model is needed to improve the prediction of OHCA and thereby improve sensitivity and specificity of the machine-learning model on recognising OHCA in emergency telephone calls.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Charlotte""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: mop,B.

Various prediction tools have been developed for the initiation of MHP, but no single tool has demonstrated strong prediction with early clinical data. We sought to develop a massive transfusion prediction model using machine learning and early clinical data. METHODS: Using the National Trauma Data Bank from 2013 to 2018, we included severely injured trauma patients and extracted clinical features available from the pre-hospital and emergency department. We subsequently balanced our dataset and used the Boruta algorithm to determine feature selection. Massive transfusion was defined as five units at 4 h and ten units at 24 h. Six machine learning models were trained on the balanced dataset and tested on the original. RESULTS: A total of 326,758 patients met our inclusion with 18,871 (5.8%) requiring massive transfusion. Emergency department models demonstrated strong performance characteristics with mean areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.83. Extreme gradient boost modeling slightly outperformed and demonstrated adequate predictive performance with pre-hospital data only, as well as 4-h transfusion thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the use of machine learning in developing an accurate prediction model for massive transfusion in trauma patients using early clinical data.

Vehicle sound identification and classification are very important in the cities to identify emergency vehicles easily and to clear the traffic effectively. Convolutional Neural Network plays an important role in the accurate prediction of vehicles during an emergency. The main motive of this paper is to develop a suitable model and algorithms for data augmentation, feature extraction, and classification. The proposed TB-MFCC multifuse feature is comprised of data augmentation and feature extraction. First, in the proposed signal augmentation, each audio signal uses noise injection, stretching, shifting, and pitching separately and this process increases the number of instances in the dataset. The proposed augmentation reduces the overfitting problem in the network. Second, Triangular Bluestein Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (TB-MFCC) are proposed and fused with Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR), Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), Root Mean Square (RMS), Chroma, and Tempogram to extract the exact feature which increases the accuracy and reduces the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the model during classification. Finally, the proposed Multi-stacked Convolutional Neural Network (MCNN) with Attention-based Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (A-BiLSTM) improves the nonlinear relationship among the features. The proposed Pooled Multifuse Feature Augmentation (PMFA) with MCNN & A-BiLSTM increases the accuracy (98.66 %), reduces the False Positive Rate (FPR) by 1.01 %, and loss (0 %). Thus the model predicts the sound without overfitting, underfitting, and vanishing gradient problems.",10.1016/j.bspc.2023.105688,

Several research works have proposed ambulance vehicle detection approaches and techniques to prioritize ambulance vehicles by turning the traffic light to green for saving patients' lives. However, the detection of ambulance vehicles is a challenging issue due to the similarities between ambulance vehicles and other commercial trucks. In this paper, we chose a machine learning (ML) technique, namely, YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once), for ambulance vehicle detection by synchronizing it with the traffic camera and sending an open signal to the traffic system for clearing the way on the road. This will reduce the amount of time it takes the ambulance to arrive at the traffic light. In particular, we managed to gather our own dataset from 10 different countries. Each country has 300 images of its own ambulance vehicles (i.e., 3000 images in total). Then, we trained our YOLOv8 model on these datasets with various techniques, including pre-trained vs. non-pre-trained, and compared them. Moreover, we introduced a layered system consisting of a data acquisition layer, an ambulance detection layer, a monitoring layer, and a cloud layer to support our cloud-based ambulance detection system. Last but not least, we conducted several experiments to validate our proposed system. Furthermore, we compared the performance of our YOLOv8 model with other models presented in the literature including YOLOv5 and YOLOv7. The results of the experiments are quite promising where the universal model of YOLOv8 scored an average of 0.982, 0.976, 0.958, and 0.967 for the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, respectively.",ARTN 2555     10.3390/app14062555,ambulance detection;machine learning;yolov8;cloud computing;human action recognition

The dynamic nature of the appearance of emergency incidents can cause delays in emergency medical services, which can sometimes lead to vital injury complications or even death, in some cases. The delay of emergency medical services may occur as a result of a call that was made too late or because no one was present to make the call. With the emergence of smart cities and promising technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and computer vision techniques, such issues can be tackled. This article proposes a human action recognition-based IoT services architecture for emergency response management. In particular, the architecture exploits IoT devices (e.g., surveillance cameras) that are distributed in public areas to detect emergency incidents, make a request for the nearest emergency medical services, and send emergency location information. Moreover, this article proposes an emergency incidents detection model, based on human action recognition and object tracking, using image processing and classifying the collected images, based on action modeling. The primary notion of the proposed model is to classify human activity, whether it is an emergency incident or other daily activities, using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed emergency detection model, several experiments were conducted using the UR fall detection dataset, which consists of emergency and other daily activities footage. The results of the conducted experiments were promising, with the proposed model scoring 0.99, 0.97, 0.97, and 0.98 in terms of sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy, respectively.",10.3390/make5010020,human action recognition;internet of things (iot);emergency response management;convolutional neural network (cnn);support vector machine (svm);fall detection;internet;things;system;intelligent

METHODS: Twenty-one university graduates and university students naive in basic life support participated in this quasi-experimental simulation pilot trial. A version beta chatbot was designed to guide potential bystanders who need help in caring for cardiac arrest victims. Through a Question-Answering (Q&A) flowchart, the chatbot uses Voice Recognition Techniques to transform the user's audio into text. After the transformation, it generates the answer to provide the necessary help through machine and deep learning algorithms. A simulation test with a Laerdal Little Anne manikin was performed. Participants initiated the chatbot, which guided them through the recognition of a cardiac arrest event. After recognizing the cardiac arrest, the chatbot indicated the start of chest compressions for 2 min. Evaluation of the cardiac arrest recognition sequence was done via a checklist and the quality of CPR was collected with the Laerdal Instructor App. RESULTS: 91% of participants were able to perform the entire sequence correctly. All participants checked the safety of the scene and made sure to call 112. 62% place their hands on the correct compression point. A media time of 158 s (IQR: 146-189) was needed for the whole process. 33% of participants achieved high-quality CPR with a median of 60% in QCPR (IQR: 9-86). Compression depth had a median of 42 mm (IQR: 33-53) and compression rate had a median of 100 compressions/min (IQR: 97-100). CONCLUSION: The use of a voice assistant could be useful for people with no previous training to perform de out-of-hospital cardiac arrest recognition sequence.

This paper addresses two efficient emergency vehicle detection (EVD) methods for restricted hardware implementation considering noisy conditions: a symbolic processing-based algorithm and a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, both of which utilize Mel spectrogram representations of Hi-Lo siren audio records. The symbolic method employs regular expressions and acceptance criteria to process text-pattern features extracted from spectrograms, offering a self-explanatory, easily tunable, and resource-efficient solution suitable for low-cost hardware platforms. On the other hand, the CNN model directly processes spectrogram representations, leveraging spatial correlation for classification with a streamlined architecture consisting of very few layers. The experimental results demonstrate that both approaches achieve high accuracy (97-98%) in classifying Hi-Lo sirens, with the CNN model exhibiting slightly better performance. Challenges such as signal noise and harmonics are addressed through iterative algorithms and signal reconstruction considerations. Future directions include identifying additional siren effects and conducting performance measurements on constrained hardware devices.

Although neurological deficits require fast initiation of treatment in a restricted time, it is difficult for nonspecialists to detect and objectively assess the symptoms. In the clinical environment, diagnoses and decisions are based on clinical grading methods, including the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score or the Medical Research Council (MRC) score, which have been used to measure motor weakness. Objective grading in various environments is necessitated for consistent agreement among patients, caregivers, paramedics, and medical staff to facilitate rapid diagnoses and dispatches to appropriate medical centers. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to develop an autonomous grading system for stroke patients. We investigated the feasibility of our new system to assess motor weakness and grade NIHSS and MRC scores of 4 limbs, similar to the clinical examinations performed by medical staff. METHODS: We implemented an automatic grading system composed of a measuring unit with wearable sensors and a grading unit with optimized machine learning. Inertial sensors were attached to measure subtle weaknesses caused by paralysis of upper and lower limbs. We collected 60 instances of data with kinematic features of motor disorders from neurological examination and demographic information of stroke patients with NIHSS 0 or 1 and MRC 7, 8, or 9 grades in a stroke unit. Training data with 240 instances were generated using a synthetic minority oversampling technique to complement the imbalanced number of data between classes and low number of training data. We trained 2 representative machine learning algorithms, an ensemble and a support vector machine (SVM), to implement auto-NIHSS and auto-MRC grading. The optimized algorithms performed a 5-fold cross-validation and were searched by Bayes optimization in 30 trials. The trained model was tested with the 60 original hold-out instances for performance evaluation in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). RESULTS: The proposed system can grade NIHSS scores with an accuracy of 83.3% and an AUC of 0.912 using an optimized ensemble algorithm, and it can grade with an accuracy of 80.0% and an AUC of 0.860 using an optimized SVM algorithm. The auto-MRC grading achieved an accuracy of 76.7% and a mean AUC of 0.870 in SVM classification and an accuracy of 78.3% and a mean AUC of 0.877 in ensemble classification. CONCLUSIONS: The automatic grading system quantifies proximal weakness in real time and assesses symptoms through automatic grading. The pilot outcomes demonstrated the feasibility of remote monitoring of motor weakness caused by stroke. The system can facilitate consistent grading with instant assessment and expedite dispatches to appropriate hospitals and treatment initiation by sharing auto-MRC and auto-NIHSS scores between prehospital and hospital responses as an objective observation.",10.2196/20641,"Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Algorithms;Biomechanical Phenomena/*physiology;Female;Humans;Machine Learning/*standards;Male;Middle Aged;Neurologic Examination/*methods;Stroke/*classification/*diagnosis;artificial intelligence;kinematics;machine learning;sensors;stroke;telemedicine"

It shows a high mortality risk when a patient is not timely treated within the golden time, prompt diagnosis with limited information such as electrocardiogram (ECG) is crucial. However, previous studies among physicians and paramedics have shown that the accuracy of STEMI diagnosis by the ECG is not sufficient. Thus, we propose a detecting algorithm based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting the STEMI on 12-lead ECG in order to support physicians, especially in an emergency room. We mostly focus on enhancing the detecting performance using a preprocessing technique. First, we reduce the noise of ECG using a notch filter and high-pass filter. We also segment pulses from ECG to focus on the ST segment. We use 96 normal and 179 STEMI records provided by Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (SNUBH) for the experiment. The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve are increased from 0.685, 0.350, and 0.526 to 0.932, 0.896, and 0.943, respectively, depending on the preprocessing technique. As our result shows, the proposed method is effective to enhance STEIM detecting performance.

As these cities are major hubs of economic activity they are one of the most densely populated cities in the world. Due to numerous such issues, ambulances are not able to reach patients and hospitals on time. In this paper, we propose a system that detects an ambulance accurately and helps set up a makeshift emergency lane on the routes to be taken by it. The system relies on a neural network-based siren classifier to detect the ambulance using audio processing. The overall accuracy of the siren classifier was 97.2 %. After the ambulance is detected this information is then passed onto a network of Internet of Things (IoT) devices that activate visual indicators on the routes to be taken by the ambulance. On activating the visual indicators the traffic on those roads can start making a temporary emergency lane. The system uses a GPS-based mobile app to get route information of the ambulance. The network of IoT devices consists of a host device and station/node devices in a chain-like connection, where all devices are communicating via local WiFi networks. The host receives information about the ambulance from the neural network and the mobile app. The host then sends this information down the chain to other node devices. Through our proposed system we hope that the transit time of ambulances is reduced and hence accident victims, heart attack patients, etc can get medical attention faster.",10.1007/s42486-022-00093-7,emergency vehicle priority systems;ambulance siren detection;internet of things;wifi based communication;audio processing;preemption

The aim of this study was to find out whether machine learning can be used in this context and to identify the predictors of subsequent events based on narrative texts of electronic patient care records (ePCR). METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of EMS patients in Finland. The data was collected from three different regions between June 1 and November 30, 2018. Machine learning, in form of text classification, and manual evaluation were used to predict subsequent events from the clinical notes after a non-conveyance mission. RESULTS: FastText-model (AUC 0.654) performed best in prediction of subsequent events after EMS non-conveyance missions (n = 11,846). The model and manual analyses showed that many of the subsequent events were planned before, EMS guided the patients to visit primary health care facilities or ED next or following days after non-conveyance. The most frequent signs and symptoms as subsequent event predictors were musculoskeletal-, infection-related and non-specific complaints. 1 in 5 the EMS documentation was inadequate and many of these led to a subsequent event. CONCLUSION: Machine learning can be used to predict subsequent events after EMS non-conveyance missions. From the patient safety perspective, it is notable that subsequent event does not necessarily mean that patient safety is compromised. There were a number of subsequent visits to primary health care or EDs, which were planned before by EMS. This demonstrates the appropriate use of limited resources to avoid unnecessary conveyance to the ED. However, further studies are needed without planned subsequent events to find out the harmful subsequent events, where EMS non-conveyance puts patient safety at risk.","The authors declare that they have no competing interests. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Leanne""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: mop,A.

Records of naloxone administration found in prehospital emergency medical services (EMS) data have helped estimate opioid overdose incidence, including nonhospital, field-treated cases. However, as naloxone is often used by EMS personnel in unconsciousness of unknown cause, attributing naloxone administration to opioid misuse and heroin use (OM) may misclassify events. Better methods are needed to identify OM. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and test a natural language processing method that would improve identification of potential OM from paramedic documentation. METHODS: First, we searched Denver Health paramedic trip reports from August 2017 to April 2018 for keywords naloxone, heroin, and both combined, and we reviewed narratives of identified reports to determine whether they constituted true cases of OM. Then, we used this human classification as reference standard and trained 4 machine learning models (random forest, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and L1-regularized logistic regression). We selected the algorithm that produced the highest area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) for model assessment. Finally, we compared positive predictive value (PPV) of the highest performing machine learning algorithm with PPV of searches of keywords naloxone, heroin, and combination of both in the binary classification of OM in unseen September 2018 data. RESULTS: In total, 54,359 trip reports were filed from August 2017 to April 2018. Approximately 1.09% (594/54,359) indicated naloxone administration. Among trip reports with reviewer agreement regarding OM in the narrative, 57.6% (292/516) were considered to include information revealing OM. Approximately 1.63% (884/54,359) of all trip reports mentioned heroin in the narrative. Among trip reports with reviewer agreement, 95.5% (784/821) were considered to include information revealing OM. Combined results accounted for 2.39% (1298/54,359) of trip reports. Among trip reports with reviewer agreement, 77.79% (907/1166) were considered to include information consistent with OM. The reference standard used to train and test machine learning models included details of 1166 trip reports. L1-regularized logistic regression was the highest performing algorithm (AUC=0.94; 95% CI 0.91-0.97) in identifying OM. Tested on 5983 unseen reports from September 2018, the keyword naloxone inaccurately identified and underestimated probable OM trip report cases (63 cases; PPV=0.68). The keyword heroin yielded more cases with improved performance (129 cases; PPV=0.99). Combined keyword and L1-regularized logistic regression classifier further improved performance (146 cases; PPV=0.99). CONCLUSIONS: A machine learning application enhanced the effectiveness of finding OM among documented paramedic field responses.

Rhythm interpretation is a key tool to retrospectively evaluate and improve the quality of treatment. Manual rhythm annotation is time consuming and an obstacle for handling large resuscitation datasets efficiently. The objective of this study was to develop a system for automatic rhythm interpretation by using signal processing and machine learning algorithms. METHODS: Data from 302 out of hospital cardiac arrest patients were used. In total 1669 3-second artifact free ECG segments with clinical rhythm annotations were extracted. The proposed algorithms combine 32 features obtained from both wavelet- and time-domain representations of the ECG, followed by a feature selection procedure based on the wrapper method in a nested cross-validation architecture. Linear and quadratic discriminant analyses (LDA and QDA) were used to automatically classify the segments into one of five rhythm types: ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), pulseless electrical activity (PEA), asystole (AS), and pulse generating rhythms (PR). RESULTS: The overall accuracy for the best algorithm was 68%. VT, VF, and AS are recognized with sensitivities of 71%, 75%, and 79%, respectively. Sensitivities for PEA and PR were 55% and 56%, respectively, which reflects the difficulty of identifying pulse using only the ECG.

The prognosis is closely related to the time from collapse to return of spontaneous circulation. Resuscitation efforts are frequently initiated at the request of emergency call center professionals who are specifically trained to identify critical conditions over the phone. However, 25% of OHCAs are not recognized during the first call. Therefore, it would be interesting to develop automated computer systems to recognize OHCA on the phone. The aim of this study was to build and evaluate machine learning models for OHCA recognition based on the phonetic characteristics of the caller's voice. METHODS: All patients for whom a call was done to the emergency call center of Rennes, France, between 01/01/2017 and 01/01/2019 were eligible. The predicted variable was OHCA presence. Predicting variables were collected by computer-automatized phonetic analysis of the call. They were based on the following voice parameters: fundamental frequency, formants, intensity, jitter, shimmer, harmonic to noise ratio, number of voice breaks, and number of periods. Three models were generated using binary logistic regression, random forest, and neural network. The area under the curve (AUC) was the primary outcome used to evaluate each model performance. RESULTS: 820 patients were included in the study. The best model to predict OHCA was random forest (AUC=74.9, 95% CI=67.4-82.4).

This study aimed to develop and validate machine learning models that could be implemented by emergency medical services (EMS) to predict refractory VF/VT in OHCA patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective study examining adult non-traumatic OHCA patients brought into the emergency department by Singapore EMS from the Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcomes Study (PAROS) registry. Data from April 2010 to March 2020 were extracted for this study. Refractory VF/VT was defined as VF/VT persisting or recurring after at least one shock. Features were selected based on expert clinical opinion and availability to dispatch prior to arrival at scene. Multivariable logistic regression (MVR), LASSO and random forest (RF) models were investigated. Model performance was evaluated using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) area under curve (AUC) analysis and calibration plots. RESULTS: 20,713 patients were included in this study, of which 860 (4.1%) fulfilled the criteria for refractory VF/VT. All models performed comparably and were moderately well-calibrated.

This paper provides a fundamental leap towards collaboration of Medicine and ICT, benefiting mankind There were three major issues faced by pre-hospital care staff from the emergency department which are lack of sound interpretation accuracy due to the interference of noise during transfer, lack of acoustic performance accuracy during transfer and lack of resource and resource management. These issues lead to delay in patient transfer to the hospital or even delay in diagnosis as the sound is not accurately interpreted by the medical practitioners due to the interference of noise and unfavourable situations during transfer. This is also imposing on the overcrowding of emergency departments and increase of waiting time due to shortage of authorised medical personnel to be on the floor for clinical. Based on the literature, the use of hybrid neural networks with bio-inspired methods to improve the efficiency in detection and classification of sounds and enables searching of similar sounds to direct towards accurate diagnostic and management pathways.

METHODS: We performed an analysis of EMS data from New York City between years 2015-2019. Our outcome was hourly EMS dispatches, expressed as continuous data. Hours were split into derivation (75%) and validation (25%) datasets. Candidate variables included averages of prior rates, temporal and weather characteristics. We used a metalearner to evaluate and aggregate individual learners (generalized linear model, generalized additive model, random forest, multivariable adaptive regression splines, and extreme gradient boost). Four models were investigated: 1) temporal variables, 2) weather and temporal variables, and datasets in which weather data were lagged by 3) six and 4) twelve hours. In exploratory analyses, we constructed learners for high acuity and trauma encounters. RESULTS: 7,364,275 EMS dispatches occurred during the 43,823-hour period. When using temporal variables, the mean absolute error (MAE) rate was 11.5 dispatches in the validation dataset. These were slightly improved following incorporation of weather variables (MAE 11.3). When using 6- and 12-hour lagged weather variables, learners demonstrated lower accuracy (MAE 11.8 in 6-hour lagged datasets; 12.2 in 12-hour lagged dataset). All models had a coefficient of determination (R(2)) >/=0.91. The extreme gradient boosting and random forest learners were assigned the highest coefficients. In an investigation of variable importance, hour of day and average EMS dispatches over the previous six hours were the most important variables in both the extreme gradient boosting and random forest learners. The algorithm performed well at predicting frequently occurring peaks, with greater challenges at both extremes. Learners created high-acuity and for trauma-related encounters demonstrated superior MAE, but with lower R(2) in the validation cohort (MAE 6.9 and R(2) 0.84 for high acuity encounters; MAE 5.3 and R(2) 0.79 for trauma in learners using time and weather variables). CONCLUSION: We developed an ensemble machine learning algorithm to predict EMS dispatches in an urban setting. These models demonstrated high accuracy, with MAEs <12 per hour in all.

To surmount this challenge, we introduced a technique for estimating the EV's position, termed ""dead reckoning,"" which leverages a deep neural network (DNN) in conjunction with an Inertial Measurement Unit (DNN-IMU). This self-contained system equips EVs with reliable navigation capabilities. In our initial phase, we designated six test routes, recording velocity, attitude (pitch and roll angle), and position data before integrating them with the DNN-IMU. These datasets underwent comprehensive training and testing. Throughout this process, we gauged the performance of the DNN-IMU using four key performance metrics, contrasting its effectiveness with prevailing methods. Simulation outcomes strongly suggest the efficacy of our proposed DNN-IMU across all six test routes. Notably, when tested in two different routes under GPS outage conditions, our method outperformed others, yielding significantly greater accuracy (92.45% for trajectory-1 and 93.62% for trajectory-2).",10.1007/s13177-023-00384-y,emergency vehicles pre-emption;dead reckoning;inertial measurement unit;deep neural network;system

It is alarming that due to the absence of a common ecosystem, the utilization of resources is inefficient, which leads to shortage of available vehicles and larger response time. Fragmentation of emergency supply chain resources motivates us to propose a new vehicle routing and scheduling model equipped with novel features to ensure minimal response time using existing resources. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data set of medical and fire-related emergencies from January 2018 to May 2018 of Uttarakhand State in India was provided by GVK Emergency Management and Research Institute (GVK EMRI) also known as 108 EMSs was used in the study. The proposed model integrates all the available EMS vehicles including partial outsourcing to non-ambulatory vehicles like police vans, taxis, etc., using a novel two-echelon heuristic approach. In the first stage, an offline learning model is developed to yield the deployment strategy for EMS vehicles. Seven well researched machine learning (ML) algorithms were analyzed for parameter prediction namely random forest (RF), convolutional neural network (CNN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), classification and regression tree (CART), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). In the second stage, a real-time routing model is proposed for EMS vehicle routing at the time of emergency, considering partial outsourcing. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results indicate that the RF classifier outperforms the LR, LDA, SVM, CNN, CART and NB classifier in terms of both accuracy as well as F-1 score.

Many models exist to optimize operational tasks such as ambulance allocation and dispatching. Including accurate demand forecasts in such models can improve operational decision-making. Against this background, we present a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that transforms time series data into heatmaps to predict ambulance demand. Applying such predictions requires incorporating external features that influence ambulance demands. We contribute to the existing literature by providing a flexible, generic CNN architecture, allowing for the inclusion of external features with varying dimensions. Additionally, we provide a feature selection and hyperparameter optimization framework utilizing Bayesian optimization. We integrate historical ambulance demand and external information such as weather, events, holidays, and time. To show the superiority of the developed CNN architecture over existing approaches, we conduct a case study for Seattle's 911 call data and include external information. We show that the developed CNN architecture outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and industry practice by more than 9%.",10.48550/arXiv.2306.04994,Computer Science - Machine Learning

The efficient dispatch and relocation of ambulances pose operational and momentary challenges, necessitating an optimal policy based on the system's real-time status. While previous studies have addressed these concerns, limited attention has been given to the optimal allocation of technicians to respond to emergency situation and minimize overall system costs.Design/methodology/approachIn this paper, a bi-objective mathematical model is proposed to maximize system coverage and enable flexible movement across bases for location, dispatch and relocation of ambulances. Ambulances relocation involves two key decisions: (1) allocating ambulances to bases after completing services and (2) deciding to change the current ambulance location among existing bases to potentially improve response times to future emergencies. The model also considers the varying capabilities of technicians for proper allocation in emergency situations.FindingsThe Augmented Epsilon-Constrained (AEC) method is employed to solve the proposed model for small-sized problem. Due to the NP-Hardness of the model, the NSGA-II and MOPSO metaheuristic algorithms are utilized to obtain efficient solutions for large-sized problems. The findings demonstrate the superiority of the MOPSO algorithm.Practical implicationsThis study can be useful for emergency medical centers and healthcare companies in providing more effective responses to emergency situations by sending technicians and ambulances.Originality/valueIn this study, a two-objective mathematical model is developed for ambulance location and dispatch and solved by using the AEC method as well as the NSGA-II and MOPSO metaheuristic algorithms. The mathematical model encompasses three primary types of decision-making: (1) Allocating ambulances to bases after completing their service, (2) deciding to relocate the current ambulance among existing bases to potentially enhance response times to future emergencies and (3) considering the diverse abilities of technicians for accurate allocation to emergency situations.",10.1108/K-11-2023-2491,emergency medical services;metaheuristic algorithm;augmented epsilon-constrained;facility location;emergency

It can also create rich databases for research and quality improvement. Unfortunately, previous attempts at ePCR and ED record linkage have had limited success. In this study, we use supervised machine learning to derive and validate an automated record linkage algorithm between EMS ePCRs and ED records. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All consecutive ePCRs from a single EMS provider between June 2013 and June 2015 were included. A primary reviewer matched ePCRs to a list of ED patients to create a gold standard. Age, gender, last name, first name, social security number, and date of birth were extracted. Data were randomly split into 80% training and 20% test datasets. We derived missing indicators, identical indicators, edit distances, and percent differences. A multivariate logistic regression model was trained using 5-fold cross-validation, using label k-fold, L2 regularization, and class reweighting. RESULTS: A total of 14 032 ePCRs were included in the study. Interrater reliability between the primary and secondary reviewer had a kappa of 0.9. The algorithm had a sensitivity of 99.4%, a positive predictive value of 99.9%, and an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.99 in both the training and test datasets. Date-of-birth match had the highest odds ratio of 16.9, followed by last name match (10.6). Social security number match had an odds ratio of 3.8.

Similar tools are lacking for pre-hospital emergency medicine. Therefore, using a national helicopter emergency medical services database, we developed and internally validated a mortality prediction algorithm. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre retrospective observational register-based cohort study based on the patients treated by five physician-staffed Finnish helicopter emergency medical service units between 2012 and 2019. Only patients aged 16 and over treated by physician-staffed units were included. We analysed the relationship between 30-day mortality and physiological, patient-related and circumstantial variables. The data were imputed using multiple imputations employing chained equations. We used multivariate logistic regression to estimate the variable effects and performed derivation of multiple multivariable models with different combinations of variables. The models were combined into an algorithm to allow a risk estimation tool that accounts for missing variables. Internal validation was assessed by calculating the optimism of each performance estimate using the von Hippel method with four imputed sets. RESULTS: After exclusions, 30 186 patients were included in the analysis. 8611 (29%) patients died within the first 30 days after the incident. Eleven predictor variables (systolic blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, Glasgow Coma Scale, sex, age, emergency medical services vehicle type [helicopter vs ground unit], whether the mission was located in a medical facility or nursing home, cardiac rhythm [asystole, pulseless electrical activity, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia vs others], time from emergency call to physician arrival and patient category) were included. Adjusted for optimism after internal validation, the algorithm had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.921 (95% CI 0.918 to 0.924), Brier score of 0.097, calibration intercept of 0.000 (95% CI -0.040 to 0.040) and slope of 1.000 (95% CI 0.977 to 1.023).

There are many reasons behind this problem, among which the common reasons are poor traffic management, cars changing lanes, unplanned stoppage, dysfunctional traffic lights, drivers not following rules, emergency vehicle priorities not met etc. To overcome such situations traffic police is placed and the traffic congestion is handled by them manually. But in congested cities, it is very tough to handle huge traffic by a traffic police manually. As more and more vehicles are being commissioned in an already congested traffic system, there is an urgent need for a whole new traffic control system using advanced technologies to utilize the already existent infrastructures to its fullest extent. In this work, we create a fully automated system for traffic control based on traffic density with the help of a machine learning algorithm. We used foreground background subtraction to identify the vehicles in each lane. Using K-nearest neighbour algorithm we computed the density of each lane. Using KNN algorithm we found the accuracy as 99.04% and recall as 73.18%. We then create a database with the density values of each lane using phpmyadmin. The density values are fetched by NodeMCU from the cloud and traffic signals are activated based on the largest density in a round robin fashion. We further improvise the system for prioritizing emergency vehicles in the congestion. We use the Yolo object detection algorithm to detect emergency vehicles like ambulances so that traffic can be cleared up for them.",10.1007/s13177-024-00400-9,adaptive signalling;emergency vehicle;smart cities;machine learning

The Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) is critical for allowing the digital and Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) for the smart healthcare world. Enhancing the dependability and flexibility of an adaptive routing algorithm improves vehicular communications' Quality of Service (QoS) effectiveness. An essential concern in vehicular technology is enabling drivers to make reliable judgments. Developing an effective routing system that ensures a suitable QoS takes time and effort. The vehicular network ecosystem is characterized by limited mobility, fast vehicle speeds, and constantly changing configurations. This study makes four distinct contributions. Initially, it presents adaptive routing protocols, capable of recognizing changes in the network environment, aware of the mobility of nodes, and dependable in delivering data packets. The experimental configuration is implemented inside a discrete Network Simulator (NS-3) scenario to enhance the QoS. Mobility-aware routing algorithms can provide ITS with satisfactory mobility, vital dependability, high Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), high throughput, and low End-to-End (E2E) Delay.

However, pausing CPR when a patient is pulseless can worsen patient outcomes. Our objective was to design and evaluate an ECG-based algorithm that predicts pulse presence with or without CPR. We evaluated 383 patients being treated for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with real-time ECG, impedance and audio recordings. Paired ECG segments having an organized rhythm immediately preceding a pulse check (during CPR) and during the pulse check (without CPR) were extracted. Patients were randomly divided into 60% training and 40% test groups. From training data, we developed an algorithm to predict the clinical pulse presence based on the wavelet transform of the bandpass-filtered ECG. Principal component analysis was used to reduce dimensionality, and we then trained a linear discriminant model using three principal component modes as input features. Overall, 38% (351/912) of checks had a spontaneous pulse. AUCs for predicting pulse presence with and without CPR on test data were 0.84 (95% CI (0.80, 0.88)) and 0.89 (95% CI (0.86, 0.92)), respectively.

Faced with fluctuating demand during the day, emergency medical systems (EMS) managers utilize redeployment strategies to meet demand. Such shifting of personnel, although better able to cover a region with fluctuating demand, can cause fatigue amongst ambulance crew members. Considering these phenomena, we extend the dynamic available coverage location model to be driven by two objectives: (1) Minimize the number of ambulances, and (2) Minimize the number of redeployments for a given fleet during a given shift. We develop a heuristic search algorithm and present the comparative statistics using real data from an urban EMS agency.

At the EMS Copenhagen 66.2% of strokes are detected by the Emergency Medical Dispatcher (EMD) and in Denmark approximately 50% of stroke patients arrive at the hospital within the time-to-treatment. An automatic speech recognition software (ASR) can increase the recognition of Out-of-Hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) at the EMS by 16%. This research aims to analyse the potential impact an ASR could have on stroke recognition at the EMS Copenhagen and the related treatment. METHODS: Stroke patient data (n = 9049) from the years 2016-2018 were analysed retrospectively, regarding correlations between stroke detection at the EMS and stroke specific, as well as personal characteristics such as stroke type, sex, age, weekday, time of day, year, EMS number contacted, and treatment. The possible increase in stroke detection through an ASR and the effect on stroke treatment was calculated based on the impact of an existing ASR to detect OHCA from CORTI AI. RESULTS: The Chi-Square test with the respective post-hoc test identified a negative correlation between stroke detection and females, the 1813-Medical Helpline, as well as weekends, and a positive correlation between stroke detection and treatment and thrombolysis. While the association analysis showed a moderate correlation between stroke detection and treatment the correlation to the other treatment options was weak or very weak. A potential increase in stroke detection to 61.19% with an ASR and hence an increase of thrombolysis by 5% in stroke patients calling within time-to-treatment was predicted. CONCLUSIONS: An ASR can potentially improve stroke recognition by EMDs and subsequent stroke treatment at the EMS Copenhagen. Based on the analysis results improvement of stroke recognition is particularly relevant for females, younger stroke patients, calls received through the 1813-Medical Helpline, and on weekends.

These algorithms are inspired by animals' physical behaviors and their evolutionary perceptions. The simplicity of these algorithms allows researchers to simulate different natural phenomena to solve various real-world problems. This paper suggests a novel algorithm called Donkey and Smuggler Optimization Algorithm (DSO). The DSO is inspired by the searching behavior of donkeys. The algorithm imitates transportation behavior such as searching and selecting routes for movement by donkeys in the actual world. Two modes are established for implementing the search behavior and route-selection in this algorithm. These are the Smuggler and Donkeys. In the Smuggler mode, all the possible paths are discovered and the shortest path is then found. In the Donkeys mode, several donkey behaviors are utilized such as Run, Face & Suicide, and Face & Support. Real world data and applications are used to test the algorithm. The experimental results consisted of two parts, firstly, we used the standard benchmark test functions to evaluate the performance of the algorithm in respect to the most popular and the state of the art algorithms. Secondly, the DSO is adapted and implemented on three real-world applications namely; traveling salesman problem, packet routing, and ambulance routing. The experimental results of DSO on these real-world problems are very promising. The results exhibit that the suggested DSO is appropriate to tackle other unfamiliar search spaces and complex problems. (C) 2019 Society for Computational Design and Engineering.

New machine learning techniques have emerged to diagnose arrhythmias on ECGs. In out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, an algorithm within an automated external defibrillator is the major determinant to deliver defibrillation. This study developed and validated the performance of a convolution neural network (CNN) to diagnose shockable arrhythmias within a novel, miniaturized automated external defibrillator. Methods and Results There were 26 464 single-lead ECGs that comprised the study data set. ECGs of 7-s duration were retrospectively adjudicated by 3 physician readers (N=18 total readers). After exclusions (N=1582), ECGs were divided into training (N=23 156), validation (N=721), and test data sets (N=1005). CNN performance to diagnose shockable and nonshockable rhythms was reported with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, F1, and sensitivity and specificity calculations. The duration for the CNN to output was reported with the algorithm running within the automated external defibrillator. Internal and external validation analyses included CNN performance among arrhythmias, often mistaken for shockable rhythms, and performance among ECGs modified with noise to mimic artifacts. The CNN algorithm achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.995 (95% CI, 0.990-1.0), sensitivity of 98%, and specificity of 100% to diagnose shockable rhythms. The F1 scores were 0.990 and 0.995 for shockable and nonshockable rhythms, respectively. After input of a 7-s ECG, the CNN generated an output in 383+/-29 ms (total time of 7.383 s). The CNN outperformed adjudicators in classifying atrial arrhythmias as nonshockable (specificity of 99.3%-98.1%) and was robust against noise artifacts (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve range, 0.871-0.999). Conclusions We demonstrate high diagnostic performance of a CNN algorithm for shockable and nonshockable rhythm arrhythmia classifications within a digitally connected automated external defibrillator.

As a first step towards this goal, we propose a method for detecting carotid artery occlusion using pulse wave measurements at the left and right carotid arteries, feature extraction from the pulse waves, and occlusion inference using these features. To meet all of these requirements, we use a piezoelectric sensor. We hypothesize that the difference in the left and right pulse waves caused by reflection is informative, as LVOS is typically caused by unilateral artery occlusion. Therefore, we extracted three features that only represented the physical effects of occlusion based on the difference. For inference, we considered that the logistic regression, a machine learning technique with no complex feature conversion, is a reasonable method for clarifying the contribution of each feature. We tested our hypothesis and conducted an experiment to evaluate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed method. The method achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 0.65, which is higher than the chance level of 0.43. The results indicate that the proposed method has potential for identifying carotid artery occlusions.",10.1038/s41598-023-30229-3,Humans;*Carotid Artery Diseases/diagnosis;*Stroke/diagnosis;*Emergency Medical Services;*Ischemic Stroke;Heart Rate;Cerebral Arteries

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using smart advanced life support trial data collected by the National Emergency Center from January 2016 to December 2019. The smart advanced life support data were randomly partitioned into derivation and validation datasets. The performance of the CAPD model using the patient's age, sex, event witness, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), administration of epinephrine, initial shockable rhythm, prehospital defibrillation, provision of advanced life support, response time interval, and STI as prediction variables for prediction of a patient's prognosis was compared with conventional machine learning methods. After fixing other values of the input data, the changes in prognosis of the patient with respect to the increase in STI was observed. RESULTS: A total of 16,992 patients were included in this study. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values for predicting prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and favorable neurological outcomes were 0.828 (95% confidence interval 0.826-0.830) and 0.907 (0.914-0.910), respectively.

Development of institution-specific prediction models is feasible in this age of data science, provided that predictor-related information is readily collectable. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a hospital admission prediction model based on patient information that is commonly available during ambulance transport before hospitalization. METHODS: Patients transported by ambulance to our ED from April 2018 through March 2019 were enrolled. Candidate predictors were age, sex, chief complaint, vital signs, and patient medical history, all of which were recorded by emergency medical teams during ambulance transport. Patients were divided into two cohorts for derivation (3601/5145, 70.0%) and validation (1544/5145, 30.0%). For statistical models, logistic regression, logistic lasso, random forest, and gradient boosting machine were used. Prediction models were developed in the derivation cohort. Model performance was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and association measures in the validation cohort. RESULTS: Of 5145 patients transported by ambulance, including deaths in the ED and hospital transfers, 2699 (52.5%) required hospital admission. Prediction performance was higher with the addition of predictive factors, attaining the best performance with an AUROC of 0.818 (95% CI 0.792-0.839) with a machine learning model and predictive factors of age, sex, chief complaint, and vital signs. Sensitivity and specificity of this model were 0.744 (95% CI 0.716-0.773) and 0.745 (95% CI 0.709-0.776), respectively.

This study validates a machine learning-based approach to generating risk scores based on hospital outcomes using routinely collected prehospital data. METHODS: Dispatch, ambulance, and hospital data were collected in one Swedish region from 2016-2017. Dispatch center and ambulance records were used to develop gradient boosting models predicting hospital admission, critical care (defined as admission to an intensive care unit or in-hospital mortality), and two-day mortality. Composite risk scores were generated based on the models and compared to National Early Warning Scores (NEWS) and actual dispatched priorities in a prospectively gathered dataset from 2018. RESULTS: A total of 38203 patients were included from 2016-2018. Concordance indexes (or areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve) for dispatched priorities ranged from 0.51-0.66, while those for NEWS ranged from 0.66-0.85. Concordance ranged from 0.70-0.79 for risk scores based only on dispatch data, and 0.79-0.89 for risk scores including ambulance data. Dispatch data-based risk scores consistently outperformed dispatched priorities in predicting hospital outcomes, while models including ambulance data also consistently outperformed NEWS. Model performance in the prospective test dataset was similar to that found using cross-validation, and calibration was comparable to that of NEWS. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning-based risk scores outperformed a widely-used rule-based triage algorithm and human prioritization decisions in predicting hospital outcomes. Performance was robust in a prospectively gathered dataset, and scores demonstrated adequate calibration.

Confidentiality has been achieved by using decentralised distributed computing to ensure security for the users without involving third-party institutions. AEPRS focuses not only on urban areas but also on semi-urban and rural areas. In urban areas where access to internet is widely available, a healthcare chatbot caters to the individual users and provides a diagnosis based on the symptoms provided by the patients. In semi-urban and rural areas, community hospitals have the option of providing specialised healthcare in spite of the absence of a specialised doctor. Additionally, object recognition and face recognition by using the concept of edge AI enables deep neural networks to run on the edge, without the need for GPU or internet connectivity to connect to the cloud.

Retrospective, manual patient record review, the current reference-standard for identifying patient cohorts, requires significant time and financial investment. We developed automated classification models to identify eligible patients for prehospital clinical trials using EMS clinical notes and compared model performance to manual review.Methods: With eligibility criteria for an ongoing prehospital study of chest pain patients, we used EMS clinical notes (n = 1208) to manually classify patients as eligible, ineligible, and indeterminate. We randomly split these same records into training and test sets to develop and evaluate machine-learning (ML) algorithms using natural language processing (NLP) for feature (variable) selection. We compared models to the manual classification to calculate sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and F1 measure. We measured clinical expert time to perform review for manual and automated methods.Results: ML models' sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and F1 measure ranged from 0.93 to 0.98. Compared to manual classification (N = 363 records), the automated method excluded 90.9% of records as ineligible and leaving only 33 records for manual review.Conclusions: Our ML derived approach demonstrates the feasibility of developing a high-performing, automated classification system using EMS clinical notes to streamline the identification of a specific cardiac patient cohort.

Machine learning (ML) predictions may support paramedic decision-making to transport a subgroup of emergent patients to a more suitable, albeit more distanced, ED if hospital admission is unlikely. We examined whether characteristics known to paramedics in the prehospital setting were predictive of hospital admission in emergent acuity patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a population-level cohort study using four ML algorithms to analyze ED visits of the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019 in Ontario, Canada. We included all adult patients (>/=18 years) transported to the ED by paramedics with an emergent Canadian Triage Acuity Scale score. We included eight characteristic classes as model predictors that are recorded at ED triage. All ML algorithms were trained and assessed using 10-fold cross-validation to predict hospital admission from the ED. Predictive model performance was determined using the area under curve (AUC) with 95% confidence intervals and probabilistic accuracy using the Brier Scaled score. Variable importance scores were computed to determine the top 10 predictors of hospital admission. RESULTS: All machine learning algorithms demonstrated acceptable accuracy in predicting hospital admission (AUC 0.77-0.78, Brier Scaled 0.22-0.24). The characteristics most predictive of admission were age between 65 to 105 years, referral source from a residential care facility, presenting with a respiratory complaint, and receiving home care. DISCUSSION: Hospital admission was accurately predicted based on patient characteristics known prehospital to paramedics prior to arrival. Our results support consideration of policy modification to permit certain emergent acuity patients to be transported to a further distanced ED.

Although one-third of all patients achieve a return of spontaneous circulation and may undergo a difficult period in the intensive care unit, only 1 in 10 survive. This study aims to improve our previously developed machine learning model for early prognostication of survival in OHCA. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied all cases registered in the Swedish Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Registry during 2010 and 2020 (n = 55 615). We compared the predictive performance of extreme gradient boosting (XGB), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), logistic regression, CatBoost, random forest, and TabNet. For each framework, we developed models that optimized (i) a weighted F1 score to penalize models that yielded more false negatives and (ii) a precision-recall area under the curve (PR AUC). LightGBM assigned higher importance values to a larger set of variables, while XGB made predictions using fewer predictors. The area under the curve receiver operating characteristic (AUC ROC) scores for LightGBM were 0.958 (optimized for weighted F1) and 0.961 (optimized for a PR AUC), while for XGB, the scores were 0.958 and 0.960, respectively. The calibration plots showed a subtle underestimation of survival for LightGBM, contrasting with a mild overestimation for XGB models. In the crucial range of 0-10% likelihood of survival, the XGB model, optimized with the PR AUC, emerged as a clinically safe model. CONCLUSION: We improved our previous prediction model by creating a parsimonious model with an AUC ROC at 0.96, with excellent calibration and no apparent risk of underestimating survival in the critical probability range (0-10%).

OBJECTIVE: We studied the association between ICD implantation prior to discharge and survival in patients with cardiac aetiology or initial shockable rhythm in OHCA. DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in the Swedish Registry for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation. Treatment associations were estimated using propensity scores. We used gradient boosting, Bayesian additive regression trees, neural networks, extreme gradient boosting and logistic regression to generate multiple propensity scores. We selected the model yielding maximum covariate balance to obtain weights, which were used in a Cox regression to calculate HRs for death or recurrent cardiac arrest. PARTICIPANTS: All cases discharged alive during 2010 to 2020 with a cardiac aetiology or initial shockable rhythm were included. A total of 959 individuals were discharged with an ICD, and 2046 were discharged without one. RESULTS: Among those experiencing events, 25% did so within 90 days in the ICD group, compared with 52% in the other group. All HRs favoured ICD implantation. The overall HR (95% CI) for ICD versus no ICD was 0.38 (0.26 to 0.56). The HR was 0.42 (0.28 to 0.63) in cases with initial shockable rhythm; 0.18 (0.06 to 0.58) in non-shockable rhythm; 0.32 (0.20 to 0.53) in cases with a history of coronary artery disease; 0.36 (0.22 to 0.61) in heart failure and 0.30 (0.13 to 0.69) in those with diabetes. Similar associations were noted in all subgroups. CONCLUSION: Among survivors of OHCA, those discharged with an ICD had approximately 60% lower risk of death or recurrent cardiac arrest.

We aimed to establish a new prognostication model based on the single variable of monitoring ECG waveforms in patients with OHCA using machine learning (ML) techniques. METHODS: This observational retrospective study included successfully resuscitated patients with OHCA aged >/= 18 years admitted to an intensive care unit in Japan between April 2010 and April 2020. Waveforms from ECG monitoring for 1 h after admission were obtained from medical records and examined. Based on the open-access PTB-XL dataset, a large publicly available 12-lead ECG waveform dataset, we built an ML-supported premodel that transformed the II-lead waveforms of the monitoring ECG into diagnostic labels. The ECG diagnostic labels of the patients in this study were analyzed for prognosis using another model supported by ML. The endpoints were favorable neurological outcomes (cerebral performance category 1 or 2) and survival to hospital discharge. RESULTS: In total, 590 patients with OHCA were included in this study and randomly divided into 3 groups (training set, n = 283; validation set, n = 70; and test set, n = 237). In the test set, our ML model predicted neurological and survival outcomes, with the highest areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.688 (95% CI: 0.682-0.694) and 0.684 (95% CI: 0.680-0.689), respectively. CONCLUSION: Our ML predictive model showed that monitoring ECG waveforms soon after resuscitation could predict neurological and survival outcomes in patients with OHCA.",10.3389/fneur.2023.1210491,electrocardiogram;machine learning;neurological outcomes;out-of-hospital cardiac arrest;outcome prediction;resuscitation

Therefore, in this study we introduce a new bi-objective model for EMS in order to reduce the rate of mobility and mortality with aim of reducing latest service completion time and total cost of system simultaneously. By recognition level of injury, we consider two types of patients: i. red code patients who have been injured seriously and have to be taken to a hospital. And ii. Green code patients who are injured slightly and are treated at the same place. Since making decision and responding to disaster situation should be with high quality within seconds, for this purpose after validating and solving that by augmented Œµ-constraint method by GAMS, we applied two NSGA-II and customized Bees algorithm for multi objective solution that called Multi Objective Bees Algorithm (MOBA) in dynamics and uncertain situation for coping high frequency within very short response time and near the optimum solution result.

METHODS: In this study, vital sign data prospectively collected from 3632 unselected prehospital patients in June 2015 were used to compare the standard NEWS to random forest models for predicting 30-day mortality. The NEWS parameters and blood glucose levels were used to develop the random forest models. Predictive performance on an unknown patient population was estimated with a ten-fold stratified cross-validation method. RESULTS: All NEWS parameters and blood glucose levels were reported in 2853 (79%) eligible patients. Within 30 days after contact with ambulance staff, 97 (3.4%) of the analysed patients had died. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the 30-day mortality of the evaluated models was 0.682 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.619-0.744) for the standard NEWS, 0.735 (95% CI, 0.679-0.787) for the random forest-trained NEWS parameters only and 0.758 (95% CI, 0.705-0.807) for the random forest-trained NEWS parameters and blood glucose.

For accurate comparison, the Gurobi optimizer was programmed with the developed model and timed for performance. A solution implementing base ranking followed by both local and Tabu search-based algorithms was created. The local search algorithm proved insufficient for maximizing coverage, while the Tabu search achieved near-optimal results. In the latter case, the total vehicle travel distance was minimized and the runtime significantly outperformed the one generated by Gurobi.

Current databases lack timelines easily constructible of clinical events. Temporal associations and procedural indications are critical to characterize treatment appropriateness. Natural language processing (NLP) methods present a novel approach to bridge this gap. We sought to evaluate the efficacy of a novel and automated NLP pipeline to determine treatment appropriateness from a sample of prehospital EMS motor vehicle crash records. METHODS: A total of 142 records were used to extract airway procedures, intraosseous/intravenous access, packed red blood cell transfusion, crystalloid bolus, chest compression system, tranexamic acid bolus, and needle decompression. Reports were processed using four clinical NLP systems and augmented via a word2phrase method leveraging a large integrated health system clinical note repository to identify terms semantically similar with treatment indications. Indications were matched with treatments and categorized as indicated, missed (indicated but not performed), or nonindicated. Automated results were then compared with manual review, and precision and recall were calculated for each treatment determination. RESULTS: Natural language processing identified 184 treatments. Automated timeline summarization was completed for all patients. Treatments were characterized as indicated in a subset of cases including the following: 69% (18 of 26 patients) for airway, 54.5% (6 of 11 patients) for intraosseous access, 11.1% (1 of 9 patients) for needle decompression, 55.6% (10 of 18 patients) for tranexamic acid, 60% (9 of 15 patients) for packed red blood cell, 12.9% (4 of 31 patients) for crystalloid bolus, and 60% (3 of 5 patients) for chest compression system. The most commonly nonindicated treatment was crystalloid bolus (22 of 142 patients). Overall, the automated NLP system performed with high precision and recall with over 70% of comparisons achieving precision and recall of greater than 80%. CONCLUSION: Natural language processing methodologies show promise for enabling automated extraction of procedural indication data and timeline summarization. Future directions should focus on optimizing and expanding these techniques to scale and facilitate broader trauma care performance monitoring.

This problem has recently received significant attention from researchers since the Covid-19 pandemic spread. In this work, we propose an efficient strategy to manage emergency calls and optimize the routes used to rescue people. In the designed model, we distinguish two groups of patients : (1) green-case patients who can be assisted directly in the scene, and (2) red-case patients in critical situations who have to be brought to hospitals. A new mathematical formulation is proposed to find the best sequence of routes for a heterogeneous fleet of ambulances that minimizes the latest service completion time. The goal is to reduce the number of patients whose conditions get worse with an untimely medical response. To solve the ARP with time windows (ARPTW), we implement the mathematical model using the Gurobi solver to generate optimal solutions for small-scaled instances. Besides, we develop two algorithms based on Tabu Search : Hybrid Tabu Search (HTS) and Tabu Search-based Hyper-Heuristic (TSHH). To validate the developed algorithms, a deep experimental study is conducted on a generated dataset.

The Tunisian ministry of health established a protocol planning the sample collection from the patients at their location. A triage score is first assigned to each patient according to the symptoms he is showing, and his health conditions. Then, given the limited number of the available ambulances in each area, the location of the patients and the capacity of the nearby hospitals for receiving the testing samples, an ambulance scheduling and routing plan needs to be established so that specimens can be transferred to hospitals in short time. In this paper, we propose to model this problem as a Multi-Origin-Destination Team Orienteering Problem (MODTOP). The objective is to find the optimal one day tour plan for the available ambulances that maximizes the collected scores of visited patients while respecting duration and capacity constraints. To solve this NP-hard problem, two highly effective approaches are proposed which are Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (HGA) and Memetic Algorithm (MA). The HGA combines (i) a k-means construction method for initial population generation and (ii) a one point crossover operator for solution recombination. The MA is an improvement of HGA that integrates an effective local search based on three different neighborhood structures. Computational experiments, supported by a statistical analysis on benchmark data sets, illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approaches. HGA and MA reached the best known solutions in 54.7% and 73.5% of instances, respectively. Likewise, MA reached a relative error of 0.0675% and performed better than four existing approaches.

Call handlers often supplement this by making free text notes covering key incident information. We investigate whether machine learning approaches using features from such free text notes can improve prediction of unconscious patients who require conveyance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed a subset of all London Ambulance Service calls that were triaged through the Medical Priority Dispatch System (MPDS) as involving an unconscious or fainting patient in 2018. We use and compare two machine learning algorithms: random forest (RF) and gradient boosting machine (GBM). For each incident, we predict whether the patient will be conveyed to a hospital emergency department or equivalent using as features 1) the MPDS code, 2) the free text notes and 3) the two together. We evaluate model performance using the area under the curve (AUC) metric. Given the imbalance of outcomes (patient conveyed 71 %, not conveyed 29 %), we also consider sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: Using only the MPDS code resulted in an AUC of 0.57. Using the text notes gave an improved AUC score of 0.63 and combining the two gave an AUC score of 0.64 (scores were similar for RF and GBM). GBM models scored better on sensitivity (0.93 vs 0.62 for RF in the combined model), but specificity was lower (0.17 vs. 0.56 for RF in the combined model). CONCLUSIONS: Using information contained in the free text notes made by call handlers in combination with MPDS improves prediction of unconscious and fainting patients requiring conveyance to a hospital emergency department (or equivalent) when compared with machine learning models using MPDS codes only. This suggests there is some useful information in unstructured data captured by emergency call handlers that complements MPDS codes. Quantifying this gain can help inform emergency medical service policy when evaluating the decision to expand or augment existing CDSS.",10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104179,"*Ambulances;*Emergency Medical Service Communication Systems;Emergency Service, Hospital;Humans;London;Retrospective Studies;Syncope;Triage;Clinical decision support;Emergency medical services;Machine learning;Medical Priority Dispatch System;Natural language processing"

For institutions with low funding, such as the RCT, relying on free or open source mapping systems to estimate travel times is necessary but also error prone because these systems are not tuned for ambulance movements within a city. Therefore, this work formulates a supervised machine learning problem where the goal is to predict the difference in travel time between the ground truth travel time provided by a GPS and the approximation offered by two mapping systems, Google Maps (GM) and Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM). To this end, this work develops a new dataset based on the EMS logs of the RCT, considering calls from January 2017 to April 2017. The posed learning problem is solved under different scenarios, including using an off-the-shelf default configuration of a Random Forest classifier, applying a hyper-parameter optimization process and using an Auto Machine Learning (AutoML) system. Considering all of the dataset for GM, test accuracy was 69.6% for the first two learning approaches and 71.6% using AutoML. For OSRM, performance was 64.6%, 65.2% and 66.4% for each of the learning approaches, respectively. Results show that it is possible to predict the level by which a mapping system over or under estimates the true travel time of an ambulance. Finally, the impact of the model is demonstrated by using it to solve the ambulance location problem, with notable differences in ambulance deployments and percentage of double coverage achieved relative to using the standard mapping system. Results show that without correcting the travel time the percentage of double coverage is 83.90%; on the other hand, double coverage reaches 100% when applying travel time correction.",10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104798,*Ambulances;*Emergency Medical Services;Machine Learning;Red Cross;Time Factors;Ambulance travel time;Emergency medical services;Mapping systems

An OHCA dataset of 1921 5s PEA signal segments from defibrillator files was used, 703 faPEA segments from 107 patients with ROSC and 1218 unPEA segments from 153 patients with no ROSC. The solution consisted of a signal-processing stage of the ECG and the thoracic impedance (TI) and the extraction of the TI circulation component (ICC), which is associated with ventricular wall movement. Then, a set of 17 features was obtained from the ECG and ICC signals, and a random forest classifier was used to differentiate faPEA from unPEA. All models were trained and tested using patientwise and stratified 10-fold cross-validation partitions. The best model showed a median (interquartile range) area under the curve (AUC) of 85.7(9.8)% and a balance accuracy of 78.8(9.8)%, improving the previously available solutions at more than four points in the AUC and three points in balanced accuracy. It was demonstrated that the evolution of PEA can be predicted using the ECG and TI signals, opening the possibility of targeted PEA treatment in OHCA.",10.3390/e23070847,electrocardiogram (ECG);out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA);pulseless electrical activity (PEA);return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC);thoracic impedance (TI)

Mistriage and subsequent interhospital transfers should be minimized to reduce avoidable mortality, life-long disabilities, and costs. Availability of a prehospital triage tool may help to identify patients in need of specialized trauma care and to determine the optimal transportation destination. METHODS: The GOAT (Gradient Boosted Trauma Triage) study is a prospective, multi-site, cross-sectional diagnostic study. Patients transported by at least five ground Emergency Medical Services to any receiving hospital within the Netherlands are eligible for inclusion. The reference standards for the need of specialized trauma care are an Injury Severity Score >/= 16 and early critical resource use, which will both be assessed by trauma registrars after the final diagnosis is made. Variable selection will be based on ease of use in practice and clinical expertise. A gradient boosting decision tree algorithm will be used to develop the prediction model. Model accuracy will be assessed in terms of discrimination (c-statistic) and calibration (intercept, slope, and plot) on individual participant's data from each participating cluster (i.e., Emergency Medical Service) through internal-external cross-validation. A reference model will be externally validated on each cluster as well. The resulting model statistics will be investigated, compared, and summarized through an individual participant's data meta-analysis. DISCUSSION: The GOAT study protocol describes the development of a new prediction model for identifying patients in need of specialized trauma care.

Our aim was to evaluate prehospital triage strategies for suspected stroke patients in the United States. METHODS: We used a decision tree model and geographic information system to estimate outcome of suspected stroke patients transported by ambulance within 4.5 hours after symptom onset. We compared the following strategies: (1) Always to nearest center, (2) American Heart Association algorithm (ie, directly to intervention center if a prehospital stroke scale suggests LVO and total driving time from scene to intervention center is <30 minutes, provided that the delay would not exclude from thrombolysis), (3) modified algorithms with a maximum additional driving time to the intervention center of <30 minutes, <60 minutes, or without time limit, and (4) always to intervention center. Primary outcome was the annual number of good outcomes, defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2. The preferred strategy was the one that resulted in the best outcomes with an incremental number needed to transport to intervention center (NNTI) <100 to prevent one death or severe disability (modified Rankin Scale score of >2). RESULTS: Nationwide implementation of the American Heart Association algorithm increased the number of good outcomes by 594 (+1.0%) compared with transportation to the nearest center. The associated number of non-LVO patients transported to the intervention center was 16 714 (NNTI 28). The modified algorithms yielded an increase of 1013 (+1.8%) to 1369 (+2.4%) good outcomes, with a NNTI varying between 28 and 32. The algorithm without time limit was preferred in the majority of states (n=32 [65%]), followed by the algorithm with <60 minutes delay (n=10 [20%]). Tailoring policies at county-level slightly reduced the total number of transportations to the intervention center (NNTI 31). CONCLUSIONS: Prehospital triage strategies can greatly improve outcomes of the ischemic stroke population in the United States, but increase the number of non-LVO stroke patients transported to an intervention center. The current American Heart Association algorithm is suboptimal as a nationwide policy and should be modified to allow more delay when directly transporting LVO-suspected patients to an intervention center.",10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.031144,Algorithms;Ambulances;American Heart Association;Decision Trees;Emergency Medical Services/*methods;Endovascular Procedures;Geographic Information Systems;Health Policy;Humans;Ischemic Stroke/*therapy;Patient Transfer;Severity of Illness Index;Thrombectomy;Thrombolytic Therapy;*Time-to-Treatment;Transportation of Patients/*methods;Triage/*methods;United States;emergency medical services;triage

Although there are protocols to guide their decision-making, observed performance can still lack sensitivity and specificity. Machine learning models have been known to capture complex relationships that are subtle, and well-trained data models can yield accurate predictions in a split of a second. METHODS: In this study, we proposed a proof-of-concept approach to construct a machine learning model to better predict the acuity of emergency cases. We used more than 360,000 structured emergency call center records of cases received by the national emergency call center in Singapore from 2018 to 2020. Features were created using call records, and multiple machine learning models were trained. RESULTS: A Random Forest model achieved the best performance, reducing the over-triage rate by an absolute margin of 15% compared to the call center specialists while maintaining a similar level of under-triage rate.

Some meteorological factors were risks of ambulance transports, but it is difficult to predict in a classically statistical way because Japan has 4 seasons. We tried to make prediction models for ambulance transports using the deep learning (DL) framework, Prediction One (Sony Network Communications Inc., Tokyo, Japan), with the meteorological and calendarial variables. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the daily ambulance transports and meteorological data between 2017 and 2019. First, to confirm their association, we performed classically statistical analysis. Second, to test the DL framework's utility for ambulance transports prediction, we made 3 prediction models for daily ambulance transports (total daily ambulance transports more than 5 or not, cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA), and trauma) using meteorological and calendarial factors and evaluated their accuracies by internal cross-validation. RESULTS: During the 1095 days of 3 years, the total ambulance transports were 5948, including 240 CPAs and 337 traumas. Cardiogenic CPA accounted for 72.3%, according to the Utstein classification. The relation between ambulance transports and meteorological parameters by polynomial curves were statistically obtained, but their r(2)s were small. On the other hand, all DL-based prediction models obtained satisfactory accuracies in the internal cross-validation. The areas under the curves obtained from each model were all over 0.947. CONCLUSION: We could statistically make polynomial curves between the meteorological variables and the number of ambulance transport. We also preliminarily made DL-based prediction models. The DL-based prediction for daily ambulance transports would be used in the future, leading to solving the lack of medical resources in Japan.",10.2147/OAEM.S293551,ambulance transport;cardiopulmonary arrest;deep learning;meteorological factors;trauma

Therefore, how to allocate resources of first-aid stations for emergency patients is an important work of emergency management. Both the distances between first-aid stations and patients and available resources need to be considered in an emergency medical resources allocation. As such, emergency medical resources allocation is a multi-objective optimization problem for optimization scheduling of resources. To solve this problem, this paper presents a mathematical optimization model and an improved multi-objective algorithm based on artificial bee colony algorithm. The algorithm is improved mainly in two aspects. Firstly, since the traditional bee colony algorithm is only to optimize single objective function, the improved algorithm adopts a new solution structure and search methods for the optimization of discrete values. Secondly, the dominated number of a solution is computed to decide if the solution is to be abandoned. Experiments show that our method achieves better results in comparison with traditional multi-objective optimization algorithms, and better time performance in practice.",10.1166/jmihi.2017.2027,bee colony algorithm;resource allocation;multi-objective;emergency medical resources;algorithm;services

We aimed to develop the Survival After ROSC in Cardiac Arrest (SARICA), a practical clinical decision tool to predict survival in OHCA patients who attained ROSC. METHODS: We utilized real-world Singapore data from the population-based Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcomes Study between 2010-2018. We excluded patients without ROSC. The dataset was segmented into training (60%), validation (20%) and testing (20%) cohorts. The primary endpoint was survival (to 30-days or hospital discharge). AutoScore, an interpretable machine-learning based clinical score generation algorithm, was used to develop SARICA. Candidate factors were chosen based on objective demographic and clinical factors commonly available at the time of admission. Performance of SARICA was evaluated based on receiver-operating curve (ROC) analyses. RESULTS: 5970 patients were included, of which 855 (14.3%) survived. A three-variable model was determined to be most parsimonious. Prehospital ROSC, age, and initial heart rhythm were identified for inclusion via random forest selection. Finally, SARICA consisted of these 3 variables and ranged from 0 to 10 points, achieving an area under the ROC (AUC) of 0.87 (95% confidence interval: 0.84-0.90) within the testing cohort.

Triage tools are crucial to identifying priority 1 (P1) patients-those needing time-critical, life-saving interventions. Existing expert opinion-derived tools have limited evidence supporting their use. This study employs machine learning (ML) to develop and validate models for novel primary and secondary triage tools. METHODS: Adults (16+ years) from the UK Trauma Audit and Research Network (TARN) registry (January 2008-December 2017) served as surrogates for MI victims, with P1 patients identified using predefined criteria. The TARN database was split chronologically into model training and testing (70:30) datasets. Input variables included physiological parameters, age, mechanism and anatomical location of injury. Random forest, extreme gradient boosted tree, logistic regression and decision tree models were trained to predict P1 status, and compared with existing tools (Battlefield Casualty Drills (BCD) Triage Sieve, CareFlight, Modified Physiological Triage Tool, MPTT-24, MSTART, National Ambulance Resilience Unit Triage Sieve and RAMP). Primary and secondary candidate models were selected; the latter was externally validated on patients from the UK military's Joint Theatre Trauma Registry (JTTR). RESULTS: Models were internally tested in 57 979 TARN patients. The best existing tool was the BCD Triage Sieve (sensitivity 68.2%, area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) 0.688). Inability to breathe spontaneously, presence of chest injury and mental status were most predictive of P1 status. A decision tree model including these three variables exhibited the best test characteristics (sensitivity 73.0%, AUC 0.782), forming the candidate primary tool. The proposed secondary tool (sensitivity 77.9%, AUC 0.817), applicable via a portable device, includes a fourth variable (injury mechanism). This performed favourably on external validation (sensitivity of 97.6%, AUC 0.778) in 5956 JTTR patients. CONCLUSION: Novel triage tools developed using ML outperform existing tools in a nationally representative trauma population. The proposed primary tool requires external validation prior to consideration for practical use. The secondary tool demonstrates good external validity and may be used to support decision-making by healthcare workers responding to MIs.",10.1136/emermed-2022-212440,Adult;Humans;*Triage;Retrospective Studies;*Thoracic Injuries;Ambulances;Machine Learning;disaster planning;major incident;major trauma management;pre-hospital care;triage

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of integrating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically OpenAI's GPT models, to standardize triage procedures and reduce variability in emergency care. METHODS: We created 100 simulated triage scenarios based on modified cases from the Japanese National Examination for Emergency Medical Technicians. These scenarios were processed by the RAG-enhanced LLMs, and the models were given patient vital signs, symptoms, and observations from emergency medical services (EMS) teams as inputs. The primary outcome was the accuracy of triage classifications, which was used to compare the performance of the RAG-enhanced LLMs with that of emergency medical technicians and emergency physicians. Secondary outcomes included the rates of under-triage and over-triage. RESULTS: The Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3.5 (GPT-3.5) with RAG model achieved a correct triage rate of 70%, significantly outperforming Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) with 35% and 38% correct rates, and emergency physicians with 50% and 47% correct rates (p < 0.05). Additionally, this model demonstrated a substantial reduction in under-triage rates to 8%, compared with 33% for GPT-3.5 without RAG, and 39% for GPT-4 without RAG. CONCLUSIONS: The integration of RAG with LLMs shows promise in improving the accuracy and consistency of medical assessments in emergency settings.

In the present study, we aimed to assess for the first time a scale that predicts the need for surgical intervention across stroke types, including subarachnoid haemorrhage and intracerebral haemorrhage. A multicentre retrospective study was conducted within a secondary medical care area. Twenty-three items, including vitals and neurological symptoms, were analysed in adult patients suspected of having a stroke by paramedics. The primary outcome was a binary classification model for predicting surgical intervention based on eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Of the 1143 patients enrolled, 765 (70%) were used as the training cohort, and 378 (30%) were used as the test cohort. The XGBoost model predicted stroke requiring surgical intervention with high accuracy in the test cohort, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.802 (sensitivity 0.748, specificity 0.853). We found that simple survey items, such as the level of consciousness, vital signs, sudden headache, and speech abnormalities were the most significant variables for accurate prediction.

Four ML algorithms, namely regularized logistic regression (RLR), random forest classifier (RF), CatBoost classifier (CBC), and voting classifier (VC), were used with data collected before CAG. The VC model showed the highest accuracy for predicting significant lesions (area under the curve of 0.751). Eight variables (older age, male, initial shockable rhythm, shorter total collapse duration, higher glucose and creatinine, and lower pH and lactate) were significant to ML models.

As the prime objective of EMS is to save people's lives by providing them with timely assistance, thus increasing the chances of a person's survivability, this paper has undertaken the problem of ambulance allocation. The work has been implemented using the proposed mutation-based Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (mSFLA) to provide an optimal allocation plan. The authors have altered the basic SFLA using the concept of mutation to improve the quality of the solution obtained and avoid being trapped in local optima. Considering a set of assumptions, the new algorithm has been applied for allocating 50 ambulances among 11 base stations in Southern Delhi. The working environment of EMS, which includes stochastic requests, travel time, and dynamic traffic conditions, has been considered to attain accurate results. The work has been implemented in the MATLAB simulation environment to find an optimized allocation plan with a minimum average response time. The authors have reduced the average response time by 12.23% with the proposed algorithm. The paper also compares mSFLA, Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for the stated problem. The algorithms are compared in terms of objective value (average response time), convergence rate, and constancy repeatability to conclude that mSFLA performs better than the other two algorithms.",10.14569/Ijacsa.2022.0130942,ambulance allocation;ambulance service;emergency medical service;shuffled frog leaping algorithm;mutation based shuffled frog leaping algorithm;location models;emergency;optimization;deployment;system;urban

At the Department of Emergency, Huizhou Third People's Hospital as the research subject, the common pre-hospital first aid procedure for infectious diseases was identified. The Petri net was used to model and determine the execution time of each link of the pre-hospital first aid process. The isomorphic Markov chain was used to optimize the pre-hospital first aid procedure for infectious diseases. In terms of the emergency path, deep learning was combined with the reinforcement learning model to construct the reinforcement learning model for ambulance path planning. Isomorphic Markov chain analysis revealed that the patient status when returning to the hospital, the time needed for the ambulance to come to designated location, and the on-site treatment were the main problems in the first aid process, and the time needed for the pre-hospital first aid process was reduced by 25.17% after optimization. In conclusion, Petri net and isomorphic Markov chain can optimize the pre-hospital first aid management strategies for patients with infectious diseases, and the use of deep learning algorithm can effectively plan the emergency path, achieving intelligent and informationalized pre-hospital transfer, which provides a basis for reducing the suffering, mortality, and disability rate of patients with infectious diseases.",10.20471/acc.2023.62.01.16,Humans;First Aid;*Deep Learning;Hospitals;Algorithms;*Communicable Diseases/epidemiology/therapy;Deep learning;Enhanced learning;Infectious disease;Isomorphic Markov chain;Path planning;Petri net

We model the problem as a multi-trip dial-a-ride problem (MTDARP), which requires designing several routes for each ambulance. A route is a sequence of locations, starting and terminating at the depot (hospital), according to which the ambulance picks up clients at the origins and delivers them to the destinations. A route is feasible only if it satisfies a series of side constraints, such as the pair and precedence constraints, capacity limit, ride time, route duration limit and time windows. Owing to the route duration limit, in particular, every ambulance is scheduled to operate several routes during the working period. To prevent the spread of disease, the interior of the ambulances needs to be disinfected at the depot between two consecutive trips. The primary aim of the problem investigated herein is to service more requests with the given resources, and to minimize the total travel cost for the same number of requests. In this paper, we provide a mathematical formulation for the problem and develop a memetic algorithm with a customized recombination operator. Moreover, the segment-based evaluation method is adapted to examine the moves quickly. The performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed using the real-world data from 2009 and compared with results obtained by solving the mathematical model. In addition, the proposed algorithm is adapted to solve the classic DARP instances, and found to perform well on medium-scale instances. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To address these issues, our aim is to develop a technology capable of extracting the intended speech content of the target physician from noisy and mixed audio during EMS tasks. In this work, we propose a monoaural personalized speech enhancement (PSE) method called pDenoiser, which is a real-time neural network that operates in the time domain. By leveraging the prior vocalization cues of emergency physicians, pDenoiser selectively enhances target speech components while suppressing noise and nontarget speech components, thereby improving speech quality and speech recognition accuracy under noisy conditions. We demonstrate the potential value of our approach through evaluations on both public general-domain test sets and our self-collected real-world EMS test sets. The experimental results are promising, as our model effectively promotes both speech quality and ASR performance under various conditions and outperforms related methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

However, there still exist gaps between the capabilities of current 5G networks and the stringent requirements of remote emergency on ambulances. Dual connectivity (DC) is an efficient technology to fill these gaps by integrating 5G millimeter wave (mmWave) with Sub-6GHz networks. In this paper, we investigate a dual-connectivity handover scheme to enhance the transmission rate of the wireless links for a 5G-enabled ambulance. Due to the long delay caused by signal transmission and processing, the conventional handover schemes based on reference signal received power (RSRP) measured by users are not sufficiently sensitive to the rapidly changing propagation environments surrounding the 5G-enabled ambulance. Instead, considering the randomness of environments and the delay caused by the handover process, we employ a deep Q network (DQN)-based algorithm to find a far-sighted policy for solving the handover problem. However, due to the drawbacks of single-step bootstrapping, value overestimation, and low-efficiency exploration, the vanilla DQN is performance-limited. To this end, we adopt effective techniques including multi-step learning, double DQN, and NoisyNet to improve learning performances, and propose a noisy double DQN (NDDQN)-based dual-connectivity handover scheme. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and superiority of our NDDQN-based handover scheme compared with the vanilla DQN and upper confidence bound (UCB)-based handover schemes, and then show that our handover scheme can adapt to various handover models.",10.1109/Tcomm.2023.3283770,handover;millimeter wave communication;gaussian processes;delays;5g mobile communication;wireless communication;urban areas;5g-enabled ambulance;dual connectivity;handover;deep reinforcement learning;mobility management;association;mechanism;networks;coverage

It is essential to schedule limited emergency resources (e.g., ambulances, operating rooms, medical personnel, etc.) efficiently in order to maximize lifesaving capabilities.

This paper addresses the combined problem of ambulance dispatching and operating room scheduling during an MCI. Specifically, we consider the limited ambulances and emergency operating rooms as reusable resources, more accurately reflecting reality than previous research.
